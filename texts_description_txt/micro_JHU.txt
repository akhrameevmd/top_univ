180.301 Microeconomic Theory
An introduction to the modern theory of allocation of resources, starting with the theories of the individual consumer and producer,
 and proceeding to analysis of systems of interacting individuals, first in the theory of exchange, then to systems which include production as well.

Prerequisites:

180.101(can be taken concurrently with 180.101)-102 and Differential Calculus 110.106, or permission of instructor

Instructor: Husain
180.401 Advanced Microeconomic Theory
This course covers roughly the same material as Microeconomic Theory 180.301 but in a more formal and mathematically rigorous way.
 You can use either 180.301 or 180.401 to satisfy the requirement for the economics major. 180.301 and 180.401 are offered during the same time slot,
 so the logistics of switching from 180.301 to 180.401 should be seamless, should you decide to make the switch. This course is suitable for those students 
who prefer a more formal treatment of economic theory and who are planning to take some of the more technically demanding electives in economics at a later stage.
 NOTE: you may not take both 180.301 and 180.401.

Prerequisites:

You may not take both 180.401 and 180.301.; 180.102 and any two semesters of calculus (or equivalent)
