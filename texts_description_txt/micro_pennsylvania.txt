ECON 101 Intermediate Microeconomics
Microeconomics is the formal study of how individuals respond to incentives
and the eect on social outcomes. Attention will focus on how the terms of trade
between buyers and sellers are set. The course emphasizes the development of the
mathematical tools needed to reason carefully about incentives and necessitates a
taste for long chains of reasoning (see below for prerequisites).
This course is not a laundry list of facts to memorize or recipies to follow. Its
purpose is to change the way you think. This will be accomplished by posing ques-
tions whose answers will challenge your intuition. Merely recording the answers
is insucient, one must understand the reasoning process by which one arrives at
them.
The course requires that one perform computations that, by themselves, are
unimportant, but are useful to convince oneself of things that one might at rst
disbelieve. Regular homework assignments will allow one to get practice at these
things.

ECON 001 Introduction to Microeconomics
Econ 001 provides a thorough introduction to microeconomic theory. Starting from the
basic ideas of tradeoffs, opportunity cost, and the benefits of trade, we will study how the
market forces of supply and demand cause prices to be what they are. We will see the
sense in which market economies are efficient, and the way governments can make our
economy less or more efficient. We will delve behind the supply curve to see how firms
choose their production levels to maximize profits, culminating in the model of perfect
competition. We will look at market failures such as imperfect competition (monopoly,
oligopoly), externalities and asymmetric information.
