Theory 

This is an advanced course on econometric theory. It intends to cover GMM, basic panel
data and time series models.

Applied Macro and Financial Econometrics
This course will examine modern applied research on macroeconomic and financial issues. The
main objective is to allow students to understand and critically appraise applied work on
macroeconomic and financial topics.

Economic Models and Introductory
Econometrics
This is a unit in basic econometrics, emphasising the problems involved in the empirical
measurement of economic relationships and the techniques used to solve these problems.
While the application of econometric techniques is of prime importance, the results are not
just presented but derived using a mixture of rigour and intuition so as to leave as few
loose ends as possible.
Econometris II: Econometric Models
This course presents and develops techniques necessary for the quantitative analysis of economic
and business problems that are beyond the scope of the simple linear regression model covered in
EMET2007 or STAT2008. Topics include: endogeneity, instrumental variables estimation, natural
experiments, binary dependent variables, and panel data estimation. This is a hand-on course
with a focus on applications in economics as well as business. A standard statistical software will
be used during computer sessions, no special programming skills are required.
