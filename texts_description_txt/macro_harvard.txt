Macroeconomic Theory and Policy
This course will teach students the basic tools of macroeconomics
and apply them to real world economic policy. The goals of the course are for students to
(a) understand how to evaluate macroeconomic conditions such as unemployment, inflation, and
growth (b) understand how monetary policy and fiscal policy can be used to influence short-run
macroeconomic conditions (c) understand media accounts of macroeconomic events. The course
will cover a broad range of topics in macroeconomic policy. Examples of issues to be discussed
include the role of fiscal and monetary policies in stabilizing the economy, the relationship
between inflation and unemployment, the role of government policy in promoting long-term
economic growth, monetary and fiscal policies in an open economy, European Monetary Union,
deficits, and stabilization and reform.
The course will be structured around the tools (models) of macroeconomics, using primarily
graphs, and occasionally equations. However, motivation for these tools, and examples of their
use will always be taken from current and recent real-world macroeconomics events and
conditions.
