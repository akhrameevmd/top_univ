Introduction to Microeconomics
Course Description: Economics is the study of how individuals, rms, and the institutions
of an economy (e.g., markets) produce and allocate scarce resources. We will examine 1) the
decision making of individuals regarding what and how much to consume, 2) the decision
making of rms regarding what and how much to produce, 3) how these decisions are coor-
dinated (for better and for worse) through market and other institutions, and 4) the role of
public policy (e.g., taxation, expenditure, and regulation).
