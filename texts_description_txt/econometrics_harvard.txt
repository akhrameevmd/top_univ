Introduction to Econometrics
We analyze the linear model as a tool for describing relationships in economic data and
associated disciplined. In particular, we will focus on best linear predictors under square
loss and analyze this prediction problem in details using cross sectional data. We discuss
nonlinear models and their approximations using linear models. Topics include: multiple
regression, instrumental variables regression, analysis of random experiments and
quasi-experiments, and regression with time series data. Students will learn how to
conduct and critique empirical studies. The course gives sufficient details on the theory
but will focus on applications. Prerequisite: Statistics 104 or equivalent.
