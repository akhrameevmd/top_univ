Macroeconomic Theory and Policy
This term’s part of ECON2004 is concerned with the open economy and with open economy aspects of the global financial crisis and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. You will frequently need to make use of the closed economy analysis covered in the autumn term.
 Please refer to the ECON2004 Moodle website for copies of the course information and for on-line material.
