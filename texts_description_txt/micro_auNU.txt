Econ 1101
MICROECONOMICS 1


The course examines how individuals and firms make decisions by weighing up costs
and benefits, and how the interaction of their decisions leads to market and social
outcomes. The model of market supply and demand is employed to examine the effects
of taxes, subsidies, and other government interventions in market activity. The
implications of different market structures, including perfect competition and monopoly,
are examined. Public goods, externalities and common resources are key examples of
cases in which private markets may yield social sub-optimal outcomes. Such cases are
examined the role of government policy in correcting for these is discussed.

Microeconomics 2

Building upon material introduced in Microeconomics 1, this course aims to provide a solid
understanding of basic microeconomic theory and the ability to apply those tools and ideas. Models
describing the economic behaviour of individual decision-makers and the outcomes of markets are
developed and applied to examine the welfare of market participants. Questions addressed include:
What influences consumer demand decisions and how? How do firms decide on how much to produce
and how much inputs to use? How do prices function to coordinate economic activity? What is meant
by economic efficiency? When do markets fail to achieve efficient outcomes? Training in economic
analysis is achieved via weekly tutorials that go over problem sets linked to material presented in
lectures. Overall, the course takes an analytical approach emphasising rigorous logical reasoning and
economic problem solving.
