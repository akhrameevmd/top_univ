Econ 104 Introduction to Eco nometrics
This course provides an undergraduate introduction to modern econometrics, in both cross-section and time-series environments.

Heavily-used site: Econometrics (open text, slides, data, code, etc.). The site is constantly evolving, so check frequently for updates. The course outline is
effectively the text's table of contents, but the slides and lectures, not the text, are the centerpiece of everything. Although the slides are self-contained,
there is no way to understand them without attending lectures, where I will interpret/embellish/generalize/specialize them, guiding you selectively. Hence
regular class attendance is absolutely essential.
