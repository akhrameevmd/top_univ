The aim of this course is to get you conversant in the language of microeconomics. When noneconomists
think about economics, they typically think of the study of unemployment, growth,
and other factors relating to the macroeconomy at large. However, behind the scenes lies a vast
array of choices and transactions carried out by individual agents; be that individuals’ choices
of whether to work, how much to save, what to buy, firms’ choices about how much to produce,
what prices to charge and whether to invest, and government’s choices about what to tax, what
to subsidise, and what goods and services to provide. These are the sorts of microeconomic issues
that we will study this term.
