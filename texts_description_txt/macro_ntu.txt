HE1002	MACROECONOMIC PRINCIPLES
In this course, we adopt the overlapping-generations model as the dynamic model to model the macro economy, and use a consistent
approach based on microeconomic foundations and the rationality of economic agents to address several issues in monetary policy,
exchange-rate policy and fiscal policy. Among other issues, the issues in monetary policy studied here include the welfare effects of
an increasing stock of fiat money, the development of financial intermediaries in the presence of differences in the rates of return
between illiquid capital and money, and the reasons for the observed correlation between the nominal money stock and real output.
The issues in exchange-rate policy studied here include the implications of different international monetary systems, the determination
of exchange rates in the presence of currency controls and the indeterminacy of exchange rates when people are free to hold
currencies of their choice.
