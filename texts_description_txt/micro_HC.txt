ECON3011 INTERMED MICROECONOMIC THEORY
This course covers the allocation, production and distribution theories in microeconomics. Topics include utility and preference, consumer demand, production and cost, market structure, general equilibrium and welfare economics. Analytical aspects will be emphasized. Mathematical concepts and maximization techniques will be used. Students should have knowledge of differential calculus, and are advised to take ECON2011 before taking this course.

ECON4010 ADV TOPICS IN MICROECONOMICS
This course covers important developments in microeconomic theory in the last two decades. Emphasis depends on the interest of the instructor. Possible topics include: contract theory, mechanism design, adverse selection, signalling theory, and principal-agent problems. This course is particularly suitable for students who aspire to graduate work. While knowledge of advanced mathematics (such as real analysis, topology, and measure theory) is not required, students should have attained a certain degree of maturity in mathematical thinking. Students are advised to take ECON1111 and 3011 before taking this course.
