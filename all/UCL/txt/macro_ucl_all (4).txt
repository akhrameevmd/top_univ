Model-building:
The medium-run model: AD-BT-ERU
• The supply side in the open economy – the downward-sloping
ERU curve and a range of constant inflation equilibria
• The full AD-BT-ERU model

Policy question
• Can the government use fiscal policy to choose a lower
equilibrium unemployment rate? … e.g. the Labour government
in the UK?

Model-building:
1. Using the AD-BT-ERU model to model external supply shocks like oil
shocks
2. Balance of payments
3. Intertemporal approach to balance of payments
• Applies permanent income hypothesis model of consumption to
country’s current account
• Intuition: current account simply reflects consumption smoothing by
borrowing and lending of optimizing agents

Policy question
• How does the policy regime affect the impact of oil shocks?
• How does the discovery of a natural resource affect the macroeconomy?

Three oil shocks
1973 OPEC I:
More than doubling in real price of oil followed by stagflation (↑π
to 15%; ↑U to 10% in US)
1979 OPEC II:
Oil price shock in 1979 followed by painful disinflation with high U
2002-2008:
Strong rises in real oil price, which peaks higher than in OPEC I or II
but inflation and U remain low
Fall in oil price:
• 1986
• 2008-2009 – financial crisis
• 2014 – xxxx – supply and
demand

Three oil shocks
Why were 1970s shocks so damaging?
• Poor understanding of nature of shock

Why were private & policy responses so different in 2002-08?

• Improved understanding of the nature of oil shocks
• New monetary policy regimes of inflation-targeting (e.g. Fed,
ECB, BoE)
• Labour market reforms weakened labour and reduced ‘real wage
resistance’

How does a model help?
An oil shock is
1. Aggregate demand shock and external trade shock – why?

2. An external supply shock – why?

We have all the ingredients to model this:
AD and BT shift
ERU shifts

How does a model help?
What does the model predict?

What was the policy response?

This explains stagflation: lower output and higher inflation
It also helps explain why 2000s was different from 1970s

Modelling an oil shock
1. Why does an oil shock depress aggregate demand & shift AD & BT left?

2. Define the external terms of trade between raw materials (oil) and
manufactures;

Assume all imports are raw materials;

Define PM
Define home’s terms of trade

Supply-side effect: Upward
pressure on inflation + higher
unemployment = stagflation

Explaining the ToT effect
q
• ERU shifts left when τ rises if workers
seek compensation in ↑W for cuts in
real wages due to higher oil prices = ‘real
wage resistance’
• We take account of ToT effect when we
have W/PC on vertical axis in WS/PS

1973 Oil shock
Flexible exchange rates, but not inflation-targeting CBs
Policy focused on offsetting negative aggregate demand effects → loose
monetary policy called ‘accommodating monetary policy’
→ Depreciation / inflation spiral:

Stagflation:
• Fuelled by
• Exacerbated by adaptive inflation expectations & real wage
resistance
UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 7

1979 Oil shock
Flexible exchange rates, change of regime
Policy shifted to non-accommodating MP (‘anti-inflation’) associated
with Thatcher in the UK; Volcker (Fed chairman in the US)
→ Keep ‘money tight’, allow unemployment to rise as necessary to
bring inflation down:

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 7

Comparison with 2002-2008 oil shock
What was different?
1. Monetary policy: inflation targeting MP NOT accommodating MP. CB will
therefore not allow a depreciation / inflation spiral. CB understands the
nature of the shock.
2.

Impact on AD of higher commodity import costs offset by household access
to

3.

Inflation target also helped anchor inflation expectations (use simulator to
see effect of anchored inflation expectations)

4.

More flexible labour markets (following labour market deregulation from the
1980s onwards) meant less ‘real wage resistance’ – workers understood that
the oil shock is a real shock to the economy and higher nominal wages will
just lead to inflation: hence ERU does not shift left (or by much less)

A positive demand and supply-side shock
Apply the model – with the usual assumptions
Consider a situation in which falling inflation could lead to
deflation – what problems could this raise?
Evaluate the potential danger of this in the light of what we
know about inflation expectations in the current period

Open economy accounting – keeping track of wealth changes
Balance of payments (Chapter 10.1.1)

BP  current a/c + capital account  0

Examples:
1. Suppose (BT + INT) > 0 and ΔR = 0

2. Suppose (BT + INT) > 0 and F = 0

account deficit, i.e. an outflow (or use) of forex (to purchase foreign assets),

Key points
• BP must by definition be zero
• Why do we care about the current account?

is changing.

• How can there be a BP crisis if BP ≡ 0?
• Crisis refers to the private balance: (BT + INT) + F
If (BT + INT) + F > 0, then ΔR > 0

If (BT + INT) + F < 0, then ΔR < 0
• CB can run out of R … this is a crisis

Inter-temporal approach to current account – how
countries can smooth consumption
Assumptions:
• Perfect international capital mobility, PCM
• Domestic consumption determined by PIH, i.e. consumption smoothing: any
expected fluctuations in hh net income can be smoothed by borrowing /
lending abroad

where y is aggregate household net income, including net income from abroad.

Accounting identities & definitions:

Intuition: if expect income to rise,
then smooth C by borrowing now,
implies CA < 0

CA  y  INT  C  I  G  y  C ,

Open economy means economy

Summary about current accounts
We have shown that a CA deficit can be benign (unproblematic) or it can be
symptomatic of macro imbalance …
1.

If CA balance reflects rational, intertemporal optimizing behaviour, then
countries will have CA surplus or deficit reflecting differences in preferences,
investment opportunities, resource windfalls, demographics
→ no policy concern

2.

Myopia (short-sightedness), political pressures, etc. may mean that e.g. CA
deficit reflects ‘too low’ rather than optimal national saving … e.g. due to
unsustainably high private consumption (e.g. based on house price bubble)
or high government spending
→ policy concern
