Problem Set Submission Policy, Econ 2007

Here are some important points regarding submissions:
1. Graded problem sets are due Wednesdays at 19:00.
2. Problem sets can be typed or handwritten (in which case you must scan the document).
3. In both cases you must merge the problem set document (pdf, scan etc.) with the UCL
coursework cover sheet.
a. The coversheet can also be downloaded from the problem set section of the course
moodle page.
b. Please read this coversheet beforehand, it provides a few more instructions on ‘how to
submit’.
PLEASE NOTE: The coversheet MUST be merged electronically with the scanned or typed problem set.
Failure to do so results in an error in the upload of the problem set. Do not scan the coversheet.
1. If you are taking pictures with your phone, please DOUBLE check to ensure the picture is of
good quality and legible. Alternatively it is also possible to use a scanning app, e.g.
Camscanner, Genius Scan etc. to create pdf scans from your phone, to ensure better quality.
2. Once you have submitted via the TURNITIN link please do check to make sure it was
successfully uploaded.
