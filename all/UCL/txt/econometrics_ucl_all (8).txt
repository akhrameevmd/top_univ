Introduction
Time-series data have a few subtle departures from cross-sectional
datasets. Most importatly:
I

There is a natural order: time flows in one direction. . . (A
sequence of random variables is called a stochastic process.)

I

Whereas in cross-sectional settings, random sampling is a typical
paradigm, time-series observations will usually be display some
dependence. Tomorrow is not completely independent from today!

I

Example: Life Expectancy in UK.

Introduction

I

To learn how today and tomorrow are related, we would like to get
many realizations for a stochastic process of interest. The thought
experiment of restarting the stochastic process to collect a
different realization of the trajectory of random variables is
nevertheless infeasible.

I

If we observe many “todays” and “tomorrows” and the relation
between them is stable we might still be able to use only one
realization of the process nonetheless.

Static Models
A static model is one in which only contemporaneous variables
appear. For example,
yt = β0 + β1 xt + ut
An example would be a (static) Philips curve:
inft = β0 + β1 unemt + ut
Another example would be the relation between life expectancy and
income per capita:
lifet = β0 + β1 log inct + ut

Finite Distributed Lag Models

A FDL model is one in which lagged explanatory variables appear as
regressors. For example,
yt = α0 + δ0 xt + δ1 xt−1 + δ2 xt−2 + ut
which is a FDL model of order 2.
δj is the change in y j periods after a temporary change in x.

Finite Distributed Lag Models

δ0 is the impact propensity or impact multiplier.
A graph of δj against j is known as the lag distribution and gives the
dynamic effect of a temporary increase in x on y .
Pq

is the long-run propensity or long-run multiplier in a FDL
model of order q and gives the overall change in y from a permanent
change in x.
i=0 δj

Finite Sample Properties of OLS

Consider again the static linear model:
yt

= β0 + β1 x1t + · · · + βk xkt + ut
= β > xt + ut

Under what conditions will OLS estimate β without bias?
As in the previous term, we need the above linear specification (TS.1)
and no perfect collinearity (TS.2) (i.e. no explanatory variable is a
perfect linear combination of the others).

de Paula (UCL)

ECON 2007: Quantitative Economics and Econometrics

7 / 45

Finite Sample Properties of OLS
We also need to avoid counfounding between xt and ut to separate the
influence of either on yt .
With a random sample where observations were independent from
each other this was achieved by the assumption that
E(ut |xt ) = 0.
This contemporaneous exogeneity is not enough to guarantee
unbiasedness since observations will not necessarily be independent
any longer. (It is nonetheless sufficient for consistency.)

de Paula (UCL)

ECON 2007: Quantitative Economics and Econometrics

8 / 45

Finite Sample Properties of OLS
Since we do not have a random sample, for OLS to be unbiased we
need to strengthen the condition above to strict exogeneity (TS.3):
E(ut |x1 , x2 , . . . , xT ) = 0
for t = 1, . . . , T .
Anything that breaks contemporaneous exogeneity (e.g., omitted
variables or measurement error) would break TS.3. It would also break
if there are lagged outcomes as explanatory variables or any type of
feedback from past outcomes into explanatory variables: explanatory
variables that are strictly exogenous cannot react to what has
happened to yt in the past.

Theorem (Unbiasedness of OLS)
Under TS.1, TS.2 and TS.3, OLS estimators are unbiased (conditional
on x1 , x2 , . . . , xT ) and unconditionally.

de Paula (UCL)

10 / 45

Finite Sample Properties of OLS
With a random sample, homoskedasticity would allow us to obtain an
expression for the variance of the estimators. This is not enough with
time series.
Here, homoskedasticity is stated in terms of all realizations of xt :
Var (ut |x1 , x2 , . . . , xT ) = Var (ut ) = σ 2

(TS.4)

This means that the residual variance does not depend on covariates
and does not change through time! It would fail for example if policy
changes affect the distribution of residuals, changing their variance.

de Paula (UCL)

ECON 2007: Quantitative Economics and Econometrics

11 / 45

Finite Sample Properties of OLS
Yet another assumption is that there be no serial correlation:
Corr (ut , us |x1 , x2 , . . . , xT ) = 0

(TS.5)

for all t 6= s.
If these hold, then:

Theorem (OLS Sampling Variances)
Under TS.1-TS.5,
Var (β̂j |x1 , . . . , xT ) = σ 2 /[SSTj (1 − Rj2 )]

de Paula (UCL)

12 / 45

Finite Sample Properties of OLS

TS.1-TS.5 also guarantee unbiasedness of the usual estimator for σ 2
(i.e., SSR/n − k − 1) and the Gauss-Markov Theorem (i.e., OLS is
best linear unbiased estimator).

Finite Sample Properties of OLS

Why these additional conditions were not necessary with
cross-sectional data?
With cross-sectional data, random sampling complements
contemporaneous exogeneity to guarantee strict exogeneity. It
also complements the usual homoskedasticity assumption to
guarantee the stricter version we presented above. Finally, it also
guarantees no serial correlation.

Dummies, Seasons and Trends
We can use transformations of the data (e.g., natural logs) much as
was done in the Term 1.
It is also customary to employ dummy variables as explanatory
variables in the analysis of time series. Because observations are
indexed by time, a dummy variable can be used to single-out particular
time-periods.
Those may be systematically different from remaining observations
because of the implementation of a new policy or changes in
government. (Of course, remember that these still need to be strictly
exogenous for the OLS estimator to have good finite sample
properties.)

Dummies, Seasons and Trends
Dummy variables are commonly used as a simple way to control for
seasonal patterns. Some economic activities such as tourism might be
influenced by weather patterns for example.
Although many datasets are pre-adjusted, one may still encounter
unadjusted data. To account for seasonal patterns we can simply
include dummy variables among the regressors. For example, for
monthly data,
yt = β > xt + δ1 febt + δ2 mart + · · · + δ11 dect + ut
where febt , mart , . . . are dummies indicating whether t is February,
March, . . . If there is no seasonality in yt (after accounting for xt ), the δ
parameters are zero.

Dummies, Seasons and Trends
Many time series display a trend which needs to be accounted for, lest
one might erroneously infer association between two trending
variables when indeed their change is unrelated to each other.
If a variables grows by the same amount on average every period, its
behavior is typically captured well by a linear trend model:
yt = α0 + α1 t + et
When the log of the variable has a linear trend, we say that the variable
itself displays an exponential trend: its growth rate is on average the
same over time:
log yt = α0 + α1 t + et

Dummies, Seasons and Trends
Trends may be important in regression analysis as well.
“[W]e must be careful to allow for the fact that unobserved, trending
factors that affect yt might also be correlated with the explanatory
variables. If we ignore this possibility, we may find a spurious
relationship between yt and one or more explanatory variables. (. . . )
Fortunately, adding a time trend eliminates this problem.” (Wooldridge,
p.363)
More concretely, one adds the time trend as an extra explanatory
variable. For example,
yt = β0 + β1 xt + β2 t + ut .

Dummies, Seasons and Trends
Because we can always “partial out” the regression (remember last
term?), we can interpret the results as a regression using detrended
data.
In other words, running OLS on the above example would give us
β̂0 , β̂1 and β̂2 . The same estimates for β0 and β1 could be obtained if
we
1. Run a regression of yt on t and save the residuals as ÿt .
2. Run a regression of xt on t and save the residuals as ẍt .
3. Run a regression of ÿt on ẍt .
It turns out that the intercept and slope coefficient estimates one
obtains are numerically identical to β̂0 and β̂1 from the original
regression!

Dummies, Seasons and Trends

If yt and xt are trending, one may then include a time trend in the
regression to prevent from finding a relationship when there is none.
Even when yt has no discernible trend, if xt has a trend we might want
to control for that. Otherwise, xt may appear as though it has not
relationship with yt when it might have one.

For example, Castillo-Freeman and Freeman (1992) examine the effect
of US minimum wage on employment in Puerto Rico. Their model is a
more sophisticated version of:
log(prepopt ) = β0 + β1 log(mincovt ) + β2 log(usgnpt ) + ut
where prepopt is the employment rate in Puerto Rico, usgnpt is the
real US gross national product (in billions of dollars) and mincovt is an
index measure the importance of minimum wage relative to average
wages.

Some caveats:
I

Be careful when yt and xt have different trends (i.e. linear versus
exponential)

I

To account for the trend in yt , use detrended yt in constructing the
R 2 for the regression with time trend. Otherwise, the R 2 will be
overstated.

Stationarity and Weak Dependence
I

The importance of stationarity and weak dependence for us is that
these notions are used in some LLN and CLT results we will use in
time series analysis.

I

A stationary process is a series whose probability distribution
remains stable over time: if we shift the sequence ahead h steps,
the join probability distribution is unchanged:
The stochastic process {xt : t = 1, 2, . . . } is stationary if for every
collection of time indices 1 ≤ t1 ≤ t2 ≤ · · · ≤ tm , the joint
distribution of (xt1 , xt2 , . . . , xtm ) is the same as the joint distribution
of (xt1 +h , xt2 +h , . . . , xtm +h ) for all h ≥ 1.

Stationarity and Weak Dependence

I

Sometimes we only require a weaker form of stationarity:
The stochastic process {xt : t = 1, 2, . . . } with finite second
moment E(xt2 ) < ∞ is covariance stationary if ( i ) E(xt ) is
constant; ( ii ) Var (xt ) is constant; and ( iii ) for any t, h ≥ 1,
Cov (xt , xt+h ) depends only on h and not on t.

Stationarity and Weak Dependence

I

The notion of weak dependence relates to how related two
rancom variables xt and xt+h are as h gets large.

I

If a process is weakly dependent, xt and xt+h are almost
independent as h gets large.

I

Different ways of mathematically formalizing “almost
independence” give rise to different forms of weak dependence.

Asymptotic Properties of OLS
I

For unbiasedness, we used three assumptions: TS.1-3.

I

For consistency, we will maintain the no perfect collinearity
condition (TS.2)=(TS.2’).

I

We will also require the linear specification to hold (TS.1):
yt = β0 + β1 x1t + β2 x2t + · · · + βk xkt + ut ,
but we will append to it the requirement that {(yt , xt ) : t = 1, 2, . . . }
be stationary and weakly dependent. (TS.1’)

I

Stationarity and weak dependence are used to establish Laws of
Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorems.

Asymptotic Properties of OLS

I

For unbiasedness, we required strict exogeneity. To attain
consistency, we can weaken that condition to contemporaneous
exogeneity (TS.3’):
E(ut |xt ) = 0.

I

This allows for feedback from past outcomes into explanatory
variables and lagged values of yt as regressors.

Asymptotic Properties of OLS
I

An important model satisfying TS.1’-3’ is the AR(1) model:
yt = β0 + β1 yt−1 + ut
where
E(ut |yt−1 , yt−2 , . . . ) = 0

I

The model is clearly linear. For stationarity and weak dependence
to hold, we need that |β1 | < 1. In this case, TS.1’ holds.

I

TS.3’ also holds.

I

OLS consistently estimates β0 and β1 .

I

β1 is biased. The magnitude of the bias depends on sample size
and how close β1 is to 1.

Asymptotic Properties of OLS

I

To obtain asymptotic distribution results, we need a version of
TS.4 and TS.5:

I

(TS.4’) The errors are contemporaneously homoskedastic:
var (ut |xt ) = σ 2 .

I

(TS.5’) No serial correlation: E(ut us |xt xs ) = 0.

I

This last condition may be delicate in static or finite distributed lag
regression models.

Example: Efficient Markets Hypothesis
Let yt be weekly percentage returns in the NYSE. A version of the
EMH states that:
E(yt |yt−1 , yt−2 , . . . ) = E(yt )
Otherwise, one could use past information to predict returns and once
such investment opportunities are noticed, any predictability would
disappear.

Highly Persistent Time Series

I

Many economic time series are not characterized by weak
dependence (e.g. T-bill).

I

To analyse those, we need to transform the data for it to be used
in statistical analysis.

Random Walk
I

An example of a highly persistent time series is the random walk:
yt = yt−1 + ut ,

t = 1, 2, . . .

where ut is independent and identically distributed with mean zero
and constant variance σ 2 . It is also assumed that the initial value
y0 is independent of ut (and typically set to zero).
I

It can be shown that
E(yt ) = E(y0 ),

for all t

and
Var (yt ) = σ 2 t

Random Walk

I

The persistent behavior of the random walk is reflected in the fact
that its present value is important even in the very distant future:
E(yt+h |yt ) = yt ,

for all h ≥ 1

I

No matter how far in the future, our best forecast is the current
value of the series.

I

In contrast, for the AR(1) process we studied earlier (with |ρ| < 1):
E(yt+h |yt ) = ρh yt

Random Walk
I

One generalization of the RW is a unit root process, which allows
ut to be dependent.

I

Another generalization is the RW with drift:
yt = α + yt−1 + ut ,

I

This introduces a trend in the expected value of yt :
E(yt ) = αt + E(y0 ),

I

t = 1, 2, . . .

for all t

It is important to note that trending and highly persistent behaviors
are different. Many highly persistent series (i.e., interest rates,
inflation rates and unemployment rates) do not present an obvious
trend.

de Paula (UCL)

ECON 2007: Quantitative Economics and Econometrics

39 / 45

Random Walk

I

One of the problems of a unit root is that OLS estimators of the
autoregressive coefficient (= 1) are consistent, but their
asymptotic distribution is not normal!

I

In fact, the estimator of the autoregressive coefficient tends to be
severely biased towards zero: the expected value of β̂1 is
approximately 1 − 5.3/T . With 20 years of quarterly data (=80
observations), the expectation is approximately 0.934.

I

Because the distribution has a long left tail, t-tests will also be
affected.

I

This series is statistically indistinguishable from a unit root (even
at 10%).

Transformations of Highly Persistent Time Series
I

Unit root processes can lead to errenous inference if the
assumptions guaranteeing the asymptotic properties fail.

I

Simple transformations may nonetheless be enough to address
some of the issues.

I

For example, if we first-difference a random walk process we end
up with a stationary process:
yt − yt−1 = ut

I

It would also remove the time trend from a trending variable
yt = α0 + α1 t + ut :
yt − yt−1 = α1 + ut − ut−1
