These are the questions for this course:

1. What is happening in the real-world macro economy?
2. How are policy choices made & what would we expect their
effects to be?
The aim is for you to be able to answer them using an organized
framework … a set of related models

How far have we got?

Progress so far
1. The core concept of arbitrage behaviour in the forex market
(there are profits to be made by anticipating what is expected
to happen in the future)  UIP and real UIP condition
How do we know what will happen to e, q NOW?

2. Medium-run model: AD-ERU model.
How do we know if the economy is in medium-run equilibrium (in

How do demand & supply shocks affect __ and __ in MRE & why
don’t they affect __ ?
3. 3-equation open economy model for flexible exchange rate
economy – i.e. where there is monetary policy at national level:
IS/PC/MR (modern monetary policy framework)
How do we get from one MRE to another following a shock?

Focus on the demand side (AD) and the trade balance (BT) … (some
of this will be familiar from ECON1001)
• Why is the AD curve positively sloped?
• If a real depreciation increases the real cost of
we know it improves the trade balance?

, how do

• Why is the BT curve positively sloped in the q-y diagram and is it
steeper or flatter than the AD?

Demand in the Open Economy
Assume we are in the short-run before the annual wage round,
Q1. What determines y?
Q2. What determines the balance of trade, BT?

Why do we care about BT?
When BT<0, M > X
→ home is borrowing from abroad and home’s wealth is
Why do changes in wealth matter?

Bringing in the richer model of imports & exports

What affects demand for imports cf. home production; demand for
our exports cf. other countries’ output?

Price-setting in the open economy
We assume
• imperfect competition,
• differentiated goods
• segmented markets
UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 5

14

2 hypotheses for price-setting

P1. Home-cost based (same as closed economy)

P2. World-price based (based on prices of similar goods in foreign
markets)

Price-setting & the real exchange rate

Example:
Home’s costs rise (↑ W and / or ↓labour productivity, λ), what
happens to PX and to RER defined as
?
Note: definition of unit labour costs: W/λ
With home-cost based price-setting i.e. P1,

With world price-setting, i.e. P2,

Price-setting & the real exchange rate

Puzzle – P2 suggests that a rise in home’s costs does not affect its
RER as defined by price competitiveness,

Is home’s competitiveness affected by higher costs?

Why?

Comparison with an integrated goods market

When the goods market is perfectly integrated across borders, Law
Of One Price holds

When LOOP holds for all goods & services in the economy, Absolute
Purchasing Power Parity holds

When LOOP & Absolute PPP & perfect competition hold then

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 5

Choosing a set of assumptions
Empirical evidence:
1. goods markets are segmented across national borders
2. much trade is in differentiated products (goods and services)
under imperfect competition
3. non-traded services are an important component of GDP

Hence,
we do not assume

How does a change in the real exchange rate affect the trade
balance?
We want to draw BT in AD-ERU diagram:
Determinants of BT:

Why is there ambiguity about the effect of Q on BT?

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 5

22

Two steps to work out implications of change in Q for BT

Step 1. Keep y fixed, i.e.

BT
Q

BT
Q

Step 2. Allow for implications of
on y, i.e. if y rises, imports
rise as well … so what is the effect on BT?

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 5

23

Step 1. The Marshall-Lerner condition: sign of

BT
Q

Economic intuition: a depreciation of Q has two effects
• it boosts home’s competitiveness raising volume of exports &
reducing volume of imports → unambiguous rise in BT
This is the
• it raises the real cost of imports (this is what causes the volume
effect for imports) → unambiguous fall in BT
This is the

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 5

24

Step 1. The Marshall-Lerner condition (cont.)

We write down BT and identify the volume and terms of trade
effects:

Which is larger?
If volume effect is ‘big enough’, then
↑Q → ↑BT

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 5

25

Step 1. The Marshall-Lerner condition (cont.)
What is ‘big enough’?

Since TT effect is exactly
sum of volume effects must >1 for

BT
0
Q

.

This is the Marshall-Lerner condition:

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 5

26

Empirical evidence

1. Shows that elasticities are large enough to satisfy M-L condition
2. In the very short-run, volumes are fixed by contracts
→ only terms of trade effect operates
→ so-called J-curve effect

dBT
Step 2. Since y is endogenous, what is dQ ?

BT  BT (Q, y, y* )
 X (Q, y* )  QM (Q, y )

We can sign the partial equilibrium effects, but what is the general
equilibrium effect?

This lecture: relating what we have done today to the AD-ERU
diagram
• Why is the AD curve positively sloped?
Because …
• Why is the BT curve positively sloped?

• Is the BT curve in the q-y diagram steeper or flatter than the AD?

We still have to show this …
UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 5

29

To show that BT is flatter than AD:
We write down the goods market equilibrium using the new export
& import functions
→ open economy IS curve

Compare with yBT, i.e. level of output, y, at which BT=0
By inspection, we can see that

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 5

30

Hence, BT is flatter than AD
Summary:
Assume r = r* and begin at balanced trade (on AD and BT)
Consider a unit increase in Q:
Step 1. If ML holds, AD and BT are positively sloped because net
exports are higher
Step 2. If the new y is lower than the new yBT, then there must be
BT surplus at the GME and hence, BT must be flatter than AD

How are the current account and the RER related? – eurozone
countries
Points to note
1. Real exchange matters for trade balance and current account
2. Eurozone highlights this as there is no variation in intra-eurozone nominal
exchange rate
3. RER measure is RULC with data here defined such that a rise in RULC is a real
appreciation

Using AD-BT-ERU
Example – Trump’s policies, the dollar and the current account
Points to note
• See Eichengreen FT article on Moodle
• Note: There is a typo in the third para. “Thus, fiscal policy will strengthen
worsen the current account of the balance of payments, …”
• For Reagan years, see Figure 11.13, p. 413
• Show the arguments about fiscal and monetary policy in the AD-BT-ERU
diagram

Summary
Key concepts: volume effect; terms of trade effect; Marshall-Lerner
condition
• Price-setting in the open economy for differentiated goods leads
to a natural definition of price competitiveness, i.e. Q
• Imports & exports depend on Q
• Opening the economy affects the IS through the multiplier and
the determinants of IS shifts
• A rise in Q (i.e. a real depreciation) improves the trade balance
• We have added to the model the BT curve & an explanation for
why it is flatter than AD … we use this result a great deal because
it will allow us to see whether a shock has led to an
improvement or deterioration in external balance… learn how to
explain it
