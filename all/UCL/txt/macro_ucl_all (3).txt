First half of the course – a balance sheet
Model-building
• MRE model (AD-BT-ERU) – equilibrium unemployment and exchange rate;
medium-run inflation rate
• 3-equation model of inflation targeting central bank – incorporating forwardlooking forex market
• Close-up on the balance of trade  Marshall-Lerner condition; BT curve
Policy questions
• Optimal response to shocks by inflation-targeting CB
• Overshooting & shocks from the forex market
Events
• Inflation and exchange rate regimes: under fixed & flexible exchange rates
• Thatcher and exchange rate overshooting; Swiss Franc
• ‘Currency wars’ (China, Japan – Abenomics, Trump) and CB policy

This lecture
Model-building
• A range of equilibrium unemployment rates in the open economy
(downward-sloping ERU curve)
• The AD-BT-ERU model with a downward-sloping ERU
• Long-run equilibrium: real exchange rate expectations

Policy questions
Can the government use fiscal policy to choose a lower equilibrium
unemployment rate?
Can a private sector boom lead to a lower equilibrium unemployment rate?
Why these questions?
Can DEMAND-SIDE policy or shocks affect equ. unemployment?

Case study – the NICE years for the British economy under the Labour
government from 1997-2007 (before the global financial crisis)

The UK economy under Labour (from 1997) – the NICE years
• Remarkably strong performance of UK economy following exit from
‘fixed’ exchange rate ERM in 1992

What was this?

UK economic performance before the global financial
crisis
Question. How was such a prolonged period of falling U without
rising π possible?
Using a closed economy model, how can you explain this?

The UK economy under Labour (from 1997) – the NICE
years before the global financial crisis
Using the open economy model:
H1. Supply-side improvements beginning with Thatcher reforms …
ERU shifts right
Use AD-ERU model for H1

The UK economy under Labour (from 1997) – the NICE years
H2. Positive aggregate demand shocks… AD shifts right and economy
moves down ERU
AD-ERU model for H2 cannot predict lower equilibrium U

→Is the ERU curve downward-sloping?
→If so, IS shocks & higher G can change

economy

Back to the model:
Why is there a range of equilibrium unemployment rates in the
open economy?
The downward-sloping ERU curve – workers care about their real wage in terms
of consumer prices (vertical ERU assumes _____ not ____ )

Deriving the ERU curve
Components: as usual, WS &PS curves
1. WS curve – we now introduce the CPI

What is the consumer price index (CPI) in the open economy?
Assume:
• all imports are final goods
• households consume a bundle of home-produced & imported final goods
Hence,

PC  (1   ) P   P*e

2. PS curve – we have to define this in terms of W/PC so we can
show PS on same diagram as WS (p.370)
We know
Compare with the
closed economy &

So much for the maths, what does it mean?
•

Consider a real appreciation due to a nominal appreciation

•

What are the implications for SUPPLY-SIDE equilibrium?

•

What happens to P (for domestic production and exports) as a
result of nominal appreciation?

All about the ERU curve
1. Use q not Q on the axis (for
convenience)
2. Why is ERU downwardsloping?

3. What shifts ERU (just as for
vertical ERU – nothing new
here)?

5. What is happening to
inflation if not on ERU?

Back to the UK economy under Labour (from 1997) –
the NICE years
H1. Supply-side improvements
beginning with Thatcher reforms;
ERU shifts right; new MRE at lower U
→ for q, U, π, BT?

H2. Positive aggregate demand
shocks (consumption, housing,
government spending)
AD shifts right; new MRE at lower U
→ for q, U, π, BT?

Summarizing the AD-BT-ERU model
The BT curve – why flatter than AD?

If the economy is above the BT curve,
there is a BT _____ and vice versa;
BT shifts with _____

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 6

17

Back to the UK economy under Labour (from 1997) –
the NICE years
H1 Supply side – how does it work?
ERU shifts right → downward pressure on inflation; looser MP; new
MRE at depreciated RER and lower U.
Model predicts:
• BT improves
• real depreciation &
• lower U

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 6

18

Back to the UK economy under Labour (from 1997) –
the NICE years
H2. Positive aggregate demand shocks (consumption, housing,
government spending) … AD shifts right; new MRE at lower U
How does it work?
AD shifts right → upward pressure on inflation; tighter monetary policy;
nominal appreciation; new MRE at appreciated RER and lower U
Model predicts:
• BT deteriorates
• real appreciation &
• lower U

Next step: check with the evidence …

The UK economy under Labour (from 1997) – the NICE
years
Step 1. Evidence on predicted outcomes
H1 and H2 both predict lower U and stable inflation
But
H1 predicts real depreciation, improvement in BT
H2 predicts real appreciation, deterioration in BT

Step 2. Evidence on causes

H1. Supply-side improvements beginning with Thatcher reforms …
ERU shifts right
Many indicators of this

• WS curve shifted ____ (weaker unions, tighter conditions for U benefits)
• PS shifted ____ (lower taxes, more product market competition)

Summary of 2 hypotheses about the NICE years
Evidence supports a synthetic hypothesis with a combination of
• ERU (supply-side) shocks – lagged effect of Thatcher reforms
• AD shocks (private and public sector spending booms)
• BT (some new sources of comparative advantage including financial
sector probably helped maintain ‘strong’ pound)

But in the long run, pressures toward

Medium- and long-run equilibrium
What happens if q E is determined by BT=0?
Begin at MRE with BT < 0.
Show that the only stable MRE is at BT=0.

What happens if at MRE, BT > 0 ?
UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 6

Summing up
1. Full model: AD-BT-ERU provides a general framework for policy
analysis & can be used to look at MRE irrespective of exchange
rate regime
2. Remember what is behind each curve, what affects its slope &
what can shift it; think about data relevant to each curve
a) AD:
the demand side, i.e. IS curve
b) BT:
X, M and their determinants
c) ERU: the supply side, i.e. WS, PS

3. Can be used in conjunction with the 3-equation model to
discuss CB’s response to shocks under flexible exchange rates
