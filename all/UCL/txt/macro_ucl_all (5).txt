Model-building:
The medium-run model:
1. Using the AD-BT-ERU model to model external supply shocks
like oil shocks
2. Balance of payments;
3. Intertemporal approach to balance of payments

Policy question
• Oil shocks
• Natural resource discovery  TODAY
• Imbalances may or may not be a problem for policy-makers 
TODAY

Model-building:
1. Sector financial balances
2. A 2-bloc model of the world economy - extending the AD-BTERU and 3-equation models
3. Global imbalances

Policy question
• Why do ‘twin’ or ‘triple’ deficits arise?
• Are national / global imbalances necessarily a problem for
policy-makers?

1. Sector financial balances
How do we relate these three:
• government’s fiscal balance
• trade balance and
• private sector’s financial balance?

Use the goods market equilibrium condition & rearrange:

Are charts like this useful? Do they show something of economic
significance? We need to use a model.
First,
Focus on the usual
analysis of GDP
Then,
Examine the sector
financial balances

How to interpret changes in financial balances (Example #1)
Use sector financial balances:
Dotcom boom & bust in US from mid 1990s:
Boom (i.e. begin with y)
• High private sector I (why?
); implies
private sector financial surplus
• Clinton uses private sector boom to consolidate public
finances so public sector financial surplus
• Some of private sector boom is financed from abroad
so external balance ________________
Bust (i.e. begin with y)
•

(Example #2)
Bush Jnr tax cuts, wars + housing boom … then bust
in 2000s:
Boom
• Private sector boom (why?
) so private
sector financial surplus
• Bush cuts taxes & increases military spending so
public sector financial surplus
• Some of private & sector deficits are financed from
abroad so external
NOTE:
Bust (Global Financial Crisis)

Summary: sector financial balances
1. Use a model to explain what happens to y
2. Use sector balances to provide another lens on what has
happened
3. Using (1) and (2) together helps diagnose the source and
consequences of phenomena such as twin or triple deficits
4. See Chapter 11 for an example using the intertemporal
approach to show how triple deficits could accompany a natural
resource windfall – in that case, deficits are

Stylized fact #1: Dramatic emergence of huge global imbalances

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 8

Stylized fact #2: Low & stable inflation

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 8

12

We need a model to show how global imbalances are consistent with stable inflation
2-bloc model with inflation-targeting central banks (strip the model to the bone)
• Assume world = 2 blocs only
• Simplify by using vertical ERU curves; ye identical in each bloc
• Simplify AD curves: by having coefficients a and b the same in each bloc and
equal to 1
• Concentrate only on the MREs not on adjustment

Now, assume AA > AB and look for new MRE
First result:
Global imbalances at the new MRE
Mechanism: Real exchange rates and BT (role of q)

2-bloc model (cont.)
Note: this is no longer a SOE model with r* exogenous.
Role of r* is to balance yD = ye at MRE for the world.
Second result: World real interest rate (role of r*)
• For the ‘world’ = country A + country B,

Summary:
• Symmetric equilibrium, i.e. A and B are identical
• If Bloc A has higher aggregate demand (e.g. permanent positive domestic AD
shock), then

Summary: global imbalances and stable inflation
Simple model
• provides an answer to the question: How are growing global
imbalances compatible with successful national inflation-targeting?
• consistent with the stylized facts of the 2000s
3 cases of global real interest rates and current account imbalances:
1. +ve domestic demand shock in bloc A only
… world real interest rate is ___________; A’s BT ___ ; B’s BT __________
2. +ve demand shock in bloc A; -ve demand shock in bloc B of equal size
… world real interest rate is _________; A’s BT _________; B’s BT ______
3. + demand shock of equal size in both blocs
… world real interest rate is ________ ; A’s BT _________; B’s BT _______
Model requires 3 rational actors solving the model … inflation-targeting
CB in each bloc; foreign exchange market
