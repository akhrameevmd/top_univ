14.01: Midterm 1 review

Unit 1: Supply and demand
•	 Lecture 2: Supply and Demand

I. Supply and demand diagrams: demand shows willingness of consumers to buy the good;
supply shows willingness of producers to sell; intersection is market equilibrium.

II. Supply and demand curves can shift when there are shocks to the ability of producers to
supply; shocks in consumer tastes; shocks to the price of substitute goods.

III. Interventions in market can lead to disequilibrium: for example, imposing a minimum
wage means that more people will want to work than employers want to hire at the
minimum wage. This creates unemployment.

IV. The cost of these interventions is found in reduced eﬃciency (trades that are not made);
there may be beneﬁts in greater equity.
•	 	 Lecture 3: Applying supply and demand

I.

Perfectly inelastic demand is characteristic of a good with no substitutes; perfectly elastic
demand is a good with perfect substitutes.

II. Price elasticity of demand is deﬁned � =

δQ
Q
δP
P

.

III. Perfectly inelastic demand is � = 0, perfectly elastic demand is � = −∞.
IV. The elasticity aﬀects consumers’ response to a shift in price: if the elasticity is between 0
and -1, then ﬁrms can raise revenues by raising the price (since consumers will still buy
the good in signiﬁcant quantities); if � < −1, then raising the price results in a decline in
ﬁrm revenue.

V. Accurately estimating an elasticity requires a shift along the supply curve (e.g., a tax on
suppliers).

Lecture 4: Preferences and utility
I. Introduction to preferences and utility
II. 	 We impose three assumptions about consumer preferences: preferences are complete, tran­
sitive and non-satiated.

III. 	 These yield four assumptions about utility curves: consumers prefer higher indiﬀerence
curves, they are downward-sloping, they never cross and there is one indiﬀerence curve
through every consumption bundle.

IV. Utility function is a function that transfers bundles of goods into a scale of utils; however,
it provides only an ordinal ranking, not a cardinal one.

V. A general assumption employed is diminishing marginal utility: consumers receive less
utility from each unit of a good they consume.

VI. M RS =

M UX
M YY

is the ratio of marginal utilities; diminishing as you move along the indif­

ference curve.
•	 Lecture 5: Budget constraints and constrained choice

I. Budget constraint over two goods X and Y is deﬁned Y = pp P + pm M .
II. Slope of the budget constraint is deﬁned as marginal rate of transformation: rate at which
you can transform one good into the other in the marketplace.

III. Shifts in price and income alter the position and slope of the budget constraint.
IV. The optimal bundle that a consumer can choose is deﬁned by the point of tangency

px
Ux
between the indiﬀerence curve and the budget line: M RS = − M
M Uy = − py = M RT . This
is equivalent to equating the marginal cost and beneﬁt of consuming each good.

V. The above equation deﬁnes an interior solution (in which the consumer consumes some of
each good); if indiﬀerence curves are ﬂat, there can also be corner solutions in which the
consumer only consumes one good.
	

•	 Lecture 6: Deriving demand curves

I. We can use the constrained optimization problem to derive the demand curve.
II. This also allows us to deﬁne the income elasticity of demand: γ =

ΔQ

Q
Δ
Y

Y .


III. For most goods, the income elasticity is positive (normal goods), but some goods may
show a consumption decline when income increases (inferior goods).

IV. An increase in price, on the other hand, has two eﬀects: it makes the consumer relatively
poorer (income eﬀect) and it also makes this speciﬁc good less attractive relative to al­
ternatives (substitution eﬀect). The substitution eﬀect can be interpreted as the shift in
goods consumed from the original point to the optimal point for a budget constraint that
has the new slope, but is tangent to the old indiﬀerence curve.

V. Substitution eﬀect is always negative, but income eﬀect can be positive.
VI. Accordingly, the overall eﬀect of a price increase on consumption of a good can be negative
(for a normal good) or positive, if the good is inferior and the income eﬀect is larger than
the substitution eﬀect.

VII. A good with a positive own-price elasticity is known as a Giﬀen good.

•	 Lecture 7: Income / substitution eﬀects and labor supply

I. 	 Income and substitution eﬀects can be used to analyze labor supply: leisure (time not
spent working) is a consumption good, and the price of that good is the wage, since that
is the opportunity cost of time not spent working.

II. 	 When the wage rate increases, this also has both an income eﬀect and a substitution
eﬀect.
–	 Income eﬀect: each worker is now richer, and may want to work less (consume more
leisure).
–	 Substitution eﬀect: returns to working are higher, each worker may want to work
more.
–	 If the income eﬀect more than oﬀsets the substitution eﬀect, labor supply may go
down when income increases.
