“Review” of what we studied so far
We have studied 2 reasons why banks (more generally a financial system) are
useful:
1.

by monitoring firms and making it harder for entrepreneurs to shirk banks allow
projects that otherwise could not be financed to be implemented (as we studied in the
Holmstrom- Tirole model)

2.

by transforming maturities they allow the savings that households wish to keep
“liquid” (i.e. immediately accessible) to be used to fund long-term projects (as we
studied in the Diamond-Dybvig model)

We have also learned (with the Tirole model) that it is important that banks be
diversified, otherwise too much liquidity may end up in some places that do
not need it, and too little where it would be needed
Finally we have learned how financial contracts may amplify macro shocks
We now ask why this helps us understand the origin of financial crisis exploded in
2007-08 and not yet over

Promises that proved ultimately empty
“Unless banks can better demonstrate their usefulness to society, they face a
debilitating battle against new regulation.”
John Gapper, Financial Times, January 10, 2012.

Playing with Fire
“Financial Innovation can do a lot of good. It its tendency to excess that must be
curbed”
Andrew Palmer, The Economist, February 25, 2012.

• This actually happened in Texas in the late 1980s. When the price
of oil fell, many Texans companies and households (Texas being an
oil-based economy) were unable to keep paying their mortgages.
Texas banks collapsed
•

To address the problem, two solutions were tried:
1. build cross-state banks which lend in many different states:
the BankofAmerica model
2. diversify via securitization

Securitization: transforming mortgages into claims to
diversified pools of money
•

Recall that owning a mortgage means owning a cash flow: the flow
of interest payments

•

A bank can sell a mortgage to a specialized firm (a "factory") that
collects thousands of mortgages and issues claims to the cash
flows they generate (a security)

•

If the cash flows are uncorrelated, buying these ensuing securities
allows investors to get rid of "local" risk (diversify)

•

These securities are sometimes called Collateralised Debt
Obligations (CDOs)
•
•

Collateralized: because guaranteed by an asset, the house
Debt: because they are a debt of the “factory”

Securitization: transforming mortgages into claims to
diversified pools of money

•

The “factory” finances its purchase of mortgages by
•

Selling CDOs to the market and the banks

•

Borrowing from the market issuing a special kind of deposits:
3-Months Commercial Paper

•

Thus the “factory” does two things at the same time:
•
•

diversification through the bundling of mortgages
maturity transformation, when it issues deposits to buy longterm mortgages

From the absence of monitoring to a “Bank Run”
 When investors realized that mortgages were no longer
monitored (and thus that banks were giving them out without
properly screening borrowers), they lost confidence in
mortgage-backed securities
 Long Term Investors were stuck with the mortgages
they had bought
 Short term investors, who had financed the
manufactures buying 3-month commercial paper, all
withdrew their deposits, like in a bank run.
(More precisely they stopped rolling over short term
commercial paper, which is the same thing)
 The manufacturers of CDOs were broke because part of the
mortgages they had bought had been financed with short
term borrowing

Some banks did not have enough capital to keep CDO manufacturers
alive: both went broke.

Bottom line: securitization gave the illusion of diversification

 Diversification is a wonderful idea -- provided it is done
right

 Banks thought they had reduced their risk selling the
mortgages, but they had not
