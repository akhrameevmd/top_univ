Unit 5: Market Power
1

Lecture 17: Oligopoly Continued (Chapter 12)
I. Cournot Math
•	 Cournot: All ﬁrms set quantities at the same time
•	 Calculate residual demand for a given ﬁrm and solve its proﬁt maximization problem to ﬁnd its
best response function to other ﬁrms’ output decisions.
•	 Solution is a set of quantities (one for each ﬁrm) that solves this system of equations.
II. Cooperative Equilibrium - Cartels
•	 Firms can form a cartel and behave like a single monopolist, maximizing total industry proﬁts.
•	 Cartels are unusual because they are fundamentally unstable (incentive to “cheat” and raise own
production) and because they are illegal (antitrust laws).

III. Comparing Equilibria
•	 In terms of welfare, usually Perfect Competition > Oligopoly > Monopoly
•	 Quantity as an indicator of social welfare
•	 DWL in welfare analysis comes from trades that aren’t made
IV. Many Firms
•	 In Cournot, as number of ﬁrms → ∞, Cournot equilibrium approaches competitive equilibrium
•	 As number of ﬁrms → 1, approaches monopoly
•	 Markup over competitive price depends on number of ﬁrms and elasticity of demand:
p − MC
1
=−
p
n�
V. Price Competition
•	 Bertrand: ﬁrms set prices (instead of quantities) at the same time
•	 Two ﬁrms may be enough to remove market power (i.e. restore competitive outcome) if products
are identical
•	 Recall proof from class that identical Bertrand duopolists drive price down to marginal cost
•	 Also recall the Stackelberg model where one ﬁrm set their quantity before the other ﬁrm. In this
case, the best response function for the Stackelberg leader takes into account the fact that the
follower will respond to the leader’s output decision.

Lecture 18: Factor Markets (Chapter 15)
I. Competitive Factor Markets
•	 In SR and in LR, demand for labor will be its marginal revenue product

M RPL = M R · M PL

where MR is marginal revenue from additional unit of output (M R = p if competitive output
market). These will diﬀer in LR and in SR because M PL in LR will take into account optimal
capital adjustments.

• LR labor demand more elastic than SR
II. Monopsony
•	 Monopsony: single buyer in input market
•	 Barriers to exit (from factor market) create monopsony
•	 Competitive ﬁrms consider price of inputs, but monopsonist looks at marginal expenditure.
M E(q) =

dT E(q)
d[p(q) · q]
=
dq
dq

•	 Takes “poisoning eﬀect” on inframarginal untis into account
•	 Increase input usage if ME<MRP, decrease if ME>MRP.
•	 Price comes from supply function
•	 Monopsonists underhire at lower wages relative to perfect competition
III. Application: Minimum Wage
•	 Higher minimum wages can restore competitive outcome in a monopsonistic market

Lecture 19: International Trade
I. What is International Trade?
•	 trade deﬁcit = imports-exports
II. Comparative Advantage and Gains from Trade
•	 Diﬀerences in opportunity costs lead to comparative advantage in diﬀerent goods
•	 When countries have diﬀerent comparative advantages in production of diﬀerent goods, there are
potential gains from trade through specialization

III. Welfare Implications from International Trade
•	 In competitive model, opening to trade increases total welfare but usually at the expense of either
consumers or producers
•	 Practice welfare comparisons using the usual graphs for imports and exports
IV. Trade Policy
•	 Eﬀects of tariﬀs and quotas

Lecture 20: Uncertainty (Chapter 17, sections 1-3)
I. Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
•	 Expected utility: probability-weighted average of utility
EU = P r(Lose) ·	U (Lose) + P r(Win) · U (Win)
•	 Diﬀerent than utility of expected value, since utility functions usually concave (diminishing MU
of income)
II. Extensions
•	 Concave utility (decreasing MU income) → risk averse
2

•	 Linear utility (constant MU income) → risk neutral
•	 Convex utility (increasing MU income → risk loving
III. Applications
•	 Insurance: risk averse people will pay money to turn a gamble into a certain payoﬀ since they get
higher utility from certain income than from a gamble with the same expected value
•	 Maximum amount they’re willing to pay for this is their “risk premium”
•	 Lottery behavior is a puzzle – maybe risk averse at low incomes and risk loving at high incomes

Lectures 21 and 22: Capital Supply and Capital Markets (Chap­
ter 16)
Lecture 21 - Capital Markets
I. Capital and Intertemporal Choice
•	 Supply of capital from household decisions about how much to save – increasing in interest
rate
•	 Demand for capital comes from ﬁrms with potentially productive investments to make
•	 Intertemporal choice graph over consumption in period one (C1 on x-axis) and in period 2
(C2 on y-axis). Slope of the BC is −(1 + r)
•	 When r changes, eﬀect on savings depends on relative size of IE and SE
II. Present Value
•	 Need to translate all future dollars into today’s terms
•	 For a single payment of FV in year t:
PV =

FV
(1 + r)t

•	 Value of a perpetuity – constant payment of f every period forever:
P V = f /r
•	 Importance of compunding
•
 Real interest rate r is the one we care about – the nominal interest rate i minus inﬂation π
r = i − π

Lecture 22 - Capital Markets II
I. Choices Over Time
•	 Choose option with highest present value when choosing between projects or investments
II. Investment Decisions
•	 Net Present Value (NPV) = PV of revenues - PV of costs
•	 Rule: Invest if NPV greater than zero
•	 if revenues Rt in each period and costs Ct , NPV of investment is:
�	
�
R1 − C 1
R2 − C2
Rt − Ct
N P V = (R0 − C0 ) +
+
+ ... +
(1 + i)1
(1 + i)2
(1 + i)t
• NPV decreasing in interest rate for projects with up-front costs and future payoﬀs
III. Increasing Savings
•	 Savings important for economic growth
•	 Government encourages savings using tax subsidies to retirement savings

Lecture 23: Equity and Eﬃciency (Chapter 10)
I. Equity and Eﬃciency
II. Choosing the Socially Optimal Allocation
•	 Social welfare function (SWF) can be though of as a utility function for society taking individual
utilities as inputs

SW F = f (U1 , U2 , . . .)

• Utilitarian SWF
SW F = U1 + U2 + . . .

• Rawlsian SWF

SW F = min(U1 , U2 , . . .)

III. Inequality in the US and Around the World
•	 See class handouts on inequality, poverty line, poverty rates over time
IV. Sources of Leakage
•	 Recall transfer program discussed in class – leads to decrease in labor supply especially among
those who qualify or are originally near the cutoﬀ to receive the subsidy.
•	 Distortionary taxation leads to DWL – this is the cost of redistribution

Lecture 24: Taxation and Redistribution
I. Taxation in the U.S.
1. Income tax (progressive, main tax in the U.S.)
2. Payroll tax (ﬂat)
3. Consumption tax (regressive, paid on spending rather than earnings)
4. Property tax (tax on wealth)
5. Corporate tax (tax on businesses, small share of total tax revenue)
II. What Should We Tax?
•	 European countries raise most revenue through VAT on consumption
•	 Consumption taxes encourage savings but not progressive
•	 Excise taxes usually on “sin goods” (goods with negative externalities in consumption)

III. What is the Right Tax Rate?

•	 Tax revenues = base · t

•	 As tax rate rises, base shrinks

d(tax revenue)
d(base)

= base + t ·
dt	
dt
•	 Laﬀer curve → tax revenue initially rising, then falling with tax rate (depends on elasticity of tax
base)
IV. Low Income Programs in the U.S.
•	 Importance of targeting assistance programs
•	 Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a wage subsidy program that balances targeting and eﬃ­
ciency
