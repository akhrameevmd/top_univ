slides are NOT a substitute for chapters 2-5 of the book. They are meant to
give you a more coincise and analytical presentation of the IS-LM model but many

Macroeconomics
To understand
how the …nancial crisis hit the real economy
how the government – through its monetary and …scal policies – was
able to alleviate the e¤ects of the …nancial shock on the economy
we need a model of the economy. Not of a single market, but of entire
economy. This is what macroeconomics is about: constructing models of
the aggregate economy and then using them to understand the e¤ects of
external shocks
policies
We start from the de…nition of the economy’s aggregate output

You can compute the change in real GDP from year t to year t + 1 in two
alternative ways
Yt +1

=
Yt

or
Yt +1
Pt +1 Qt +1
=

by P1,+1 /P2,t +1 you

can verify that the two ways of computing the change in real GDP from year t to
year t + 1 are equal only if P1,t /P2,t = P1,+1 /P2,t +1 . Since the relative price
of goods changes over time, this condition will in general not be satis…ed. Thus
the two expressions will give you two di¤erent changes in real GDP.

Finally it is customary to compute the change in real GDP using an index that is
(aribitrarily) set to be equal to 100 in a "base" year, say the year 2000:

chain index2000 = 100
chain index2001 = 100 g(01/00 )

The Model of the Goods (and Services) Market (Model 1)
We proceed in steps, starting from the simplest model and then making
more complicated (realistic) by relaxing assumptions.
Model 1: The Goods market
1 market: the market for goods and services
1 variable to determine: the level of production, or output
(Y = GDP)
1 equilibrium condition to determine it:
Supply of Y = Demand for Y

Supply of Y
The economy is closed: no goods are exported or imported
The price of Y is …xed
P (Y ) = P = 1
Therefore (for the time being)
$Y = Y
What does this assumption mean:
Output is determined by demand: at the …x price P = 1 …rms
produce any amount of Y needed to satisfy demand

Consumption is a function of disposable income (income net of taxes)
C = c Y Disposable

Equilibrium in the Goods Market

The "equilibrium" level of Y is the level that clears the market, i.e.
makes supply equal to demand
Y = Z = C + I + G = c0 + c1 ( Y

T) + I + G

Thus the level of Y that clears the market is
Y = c 0 + c 1 (Y

So far we have assumed
Output t =

∑ Final

Sales t

where t refers to some year.
What if not all output produced in year t is sold in year t ? Consider two
extreme cases:
∑ Final Salest = Outputt 1
or
Outputt =

Salest = ∆Inventoriest

∆Inventories are called Inventory Investment. (Note Inventories are not

A useful exercise: the Balanced-Budget Multiplier
What is the e¤ect on Y of an increase in G fully …nanced by a
corresponding increse in T
dG = dT

Y = c0 + c1 ( Y
dY
dT

= c1 (dY
= dG

dY (1

T) + I + G
dT ) + dG

c1 ) = dT (1

c1 )

dY = dT = dG
the multiplier is 1. You still get a positive e¤ect, but not bigger than 1:
the private sector (Consumption) does not move, thus there is no
"multiplier e¤ect".

The "Paradox" of Saving

Suppose consumers decide to save more at any level of Y . This means
that c0 falls. What happens to Saving ?
S PR =

c0 + ( 1

c1 ) Y

T

As c0 falls consumers tend to save more, but their income Y will also be
lower, which will reduce S. What is the net e¤ect? Remember that – when
there is equilibrium in the goods market – saving is equal to investment
I = S PR + T

G =S

then the net e¤ect is zero.

prices ? NOT in the Short Run. Prices are slow to respond. Our
assumption that prices are …xed is, as we shall see, not too bad. We

…nancial markets? YES: the price of …nancial assets responds
instanteneously to news.

We thus extend the model adding a …nancial sector

Introducing Financial Markets
Financial markets include many assets with decreasing degrees of
liquidity. From the most liquid (money) to the less liquid (equity)
I

cash, demand deposits, saving deposits, money market mutual funds,
government bonds, corporate bonds, equity

Start from the essentials. Assume there are only two …nancial assets
I
I

"money" (cash, demand deposits), that pays no interest
bonds, that pay an interest rate i per period

Think of the problem of how to allocate a given amount W between
bonds and cash: the higher the interest the larger the fraction of W
you will want to keep in bonds, and thus the more often you will go
to the bank to sell bonds and get cash.

The demand for …nancial assets
Demand for "money" (M d ), the most liquid asset
M d = L (Y , i )
we shall assume L (Y , i ) = f1 Y f2 i with f1 , f2 (f1 , f2 > 0) two positive
parameters, so that
M d = f1 Y f2 i
Demand for Bonds (B d )
Bd = W

Md

where W is your wealth, which is divided between money and bonds.
Note: given W , if you know M d you do not need a second equation to
compute B

"Stock" and "Flow" variables

So far we have introduced two types of variables in our model
Flow variables. Y , C : these are measured as ‡ows per unit time. For
instance C is consumption per period, e.g. per year
Stock variables. B, W , M: these are stocks at any moment in time

Equilibrium in the …nancial market

As we said, one equilibrium condition is enough — because once we
know M, given W , we know B = W M
Equilibrium requires that the demand for money, M d , equals the
quantity of money that the central bank has put in the economy,
which, for the time being, we assume to be a …xed quantity M
Md = M
M d = L (Y , i ) = M
this equation determines the interest rate i for any given level of Y
and M
