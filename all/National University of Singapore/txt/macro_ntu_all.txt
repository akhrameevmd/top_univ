HE1002 –PRINCIPLES OF MACROECONOMICS
Semester 1, 2014/2015
Course Description and Scope
Macroeconomics is the study of issues that affect the economy as a whole. This course
starts with the definition and measurement of three major concerns in macroeconomics: national
output, unemployment and inflation. The core of the course explores three important questions:
What causes unemployment? What causes inflation? And what are the impacts of fiscal policy
and monetary policy on short-run output? In addition, students will be introduced to the
determinants of long-run economic growth and the macroeconomic impact of exchange rate and
foreign trade. The course aims to provide students with a sound understanding on the structure
and functioning of the economy as a whole. As a result, students will learn to apply
macroeconomic principles to analyze real-world events, and develop interests in studying these
issues further in more advanced macroeconomic courses.
Textbooks
The main textbook is Principles of Macroeconomics, any edition from 8th to 11th, by Karl
Case, Ray Fair and Sharon Oster, Pearson Prentice Hall (NTU Library Call
Number: HB172.5.C337). Besides, Principles of Macroeconomics, by Gregory Mankiw is highly
recommended for extensive reading. Students with a strong theoretical preference and
mathematical background are suggested to enjoy the textbook of Macroeconomics, by Andrew
B. Abel, Ben S. Bernanke and Dean Croushore.
