Textbook	and	Required	Course	Materials	
	
The	textbook	for	this	course	is	Microeconomics:	An	Intuitive	Approach	with	Calculus,	
2nd	Edition,	by	Thomas	Nechyba.	The	publisher	has	online	materials	related	to	this	
textbook	available	on	a	website	called	MindTap.	Access	to	the	MindTap	website	is	
REQUIRED	for	this	course.	You	will	use	it	to	submit	internet-based	assignments.	
This	site	also	includes	other	resources,	including	an	electronic	copy	of	the	entire	
textbook,	interactive	graphs,	and	video	presentations.	When	you	set	up	MindTap,	
you	will	need	to	link	to	our	course,	which	can	be	done	by	visiting	the	following	
course-specific	registration	link:	
https://login.cengagebrain.com/course/MTPQZWPP8DKH	
	
Going	“electronic-only”:	The	bookstore	should	have	a	bundle	available	that	
includes	a	hardcopy	of	the	textbook	together	with	an	access	card	that	can	be	
used	as	the	form	of	payment	when	you	visit	the	MindTap	website	listed	
above.	(Note	that	you	will	most	likely	not	get	the	appropriate	access	card	if	
you	purchase	your	textbook	from	Amazon	or	some	other	online	retailer.)	
Alternatively,	you	have	the	option	to	only	purchase	online	access	using	the	
link	above	and	skip	the	hardcopy.	A	trial	period	is	also	available	on	the	site.	
Please	see	the	announcement	on	Sakai	for	additional	information.	
	
To	Calc,	or	not	to	Calc,	that	is	the	question:	Economics	201	is	a	rigorous	but	
largely	non-mathematical	development	of	the	fundamental	concepts	in	
microeconomics.	It	emphasizes	logical	arguments	and	graphical	modeling	
techniques	together	with	some	formal	mathematical	analysis;	however,	the	
complete	mathematical	treatment	these	topics	is	reserved	for	Economics	
205.	In	the	textbook,	chapters	are	divided	into	A	and	B	parts,	with	the	
mathematical	treatment	involving	calculus	developed	in	the	B	parts.	This	
course	will	focus	primarily	on	the	A	parts	of	each	chapter,	but	you	may	find	
the	B	parts	useful	for	reference.	

	
	
Lectures,	Discussion	Sections,	and	Office	Hours	
	
Lectures:	Class	lectures	will	be	a	mix	of	traditional	lectures	and	time	spent	
working	together	on	applications	and	exercises.	To	free	up	more	time	for	
working	through	problems	together,	I	may	ask	you	to	watch	brief	video	
modules	prior	to	some	classes.	These	will	be	posted	on	Sakai	several	days	
before	the	class	in	which	we	will	use	the	material	in	the	module.	
	
Discussion	Sections	and	TAs:	Discussion	sections	are	run	by	Teaching	
Assistants	(TAs).	Their	main	purpose	is	to	give	you	an	opportunity	to	clarify	
your	understanding	of	the	topics	from	the	lecture	and	textbook.	Sections	will	
often	be	used	to	work	together	through	exercises	and	to	cover	material	that	
will	do	not	get	to	in	lectures,	or	to	review	material	from	the	lectures.	The	
most	valuable	function	of	the	TAs	is	to	answer	your	questions	about	problem	
sets	and	the	course	material	more	generally.	You	should	also	view	your	TAs	
as	a	channel	to	voice	concerns	about	the	course	in	circumstances	where	you	
feel	uncomfortable	approaching	me	directly.	
	
The	schedule	for	discussion	sections	will	be	posted	on	Sakai	in	the	coming	
week,	and	sections	will	begin	on	January	25.	The	sessions	will	be	
coordinated	so	that	the	same	material	is	covered	in	the	sections	starting	on	
any	given	Wednesday	through	the	subsequent	Tuesday.	Although	you	were	
required	to	pick	sections	when	registering	for	the	course,	you	are	free	to	
attend	whichever	(and	however	many)	sections	you	wish.	
	
Office	Hours:	The	schedule	for	office	hours	for	the	TAs	will	be	posted	on	Sakai	
in	the	coming	week	and	will	begin	on	January	25.	My	office	hours	are	listed	
above.	Note	that	they	begin	immediately	following	class.	I	will	remain	in	the	
classroom	right	after	each	lecture	to	take	questions,	and	we	can	move	to	my	
office	once	it	is	time	for	the	next	class	to	begin	in	the	auditorium.	
	
	
Evaluation:	Exams,	Assignments,	and	Attendance	
	
Grades	are	determined	by	two	midterm	exams	(25%	each),	a	cumulative	final	exam	
(40%),	and	MindTap	assignments	and	attendance	(10%).	However,	if	your	score	on	
the	final	exam	is	higher	than	on	one	of	the	midterms,	weight	will	be	moved	from	
that	midterm	to	the	final.	Your	final	course	grade	is	therefore	determined	by	the	
following	formula:	
0.1	𝑀𝑇	𝑎𝑛𝑑	𝐴	 + 0.25𝑀1 + 0.25𝑀2 + 0.4𝐹,
𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥
	
0.1	𝑀𝑇	𝑎𝑛𝑑	𝐴	 + 0.25𝑀1 + 0.65𝐹,
0.1	𝑀𝑇	𝑎𝑛𝑑	𝐴	 + 0.25𝑀2 + 0.65𝐹
	
(MT=MindTap	assignments,	A=Attendance,	M1=Midterm	1,	M2=Midterm	2,	F=Final)	

	
Midterms:	The	midterm	exams	are	scheduled	for	Wednesday,	February	15	
and	Wednesday,	April	5.	These	dates	should	be	assumed	fixed	unless	an	
announcement	to	the	contrary	is	made	in	class.	If	you	miss	a	midterm	and	
have	a	legitimate	excuse,	the	weight	for	that	exam	will	be	reallocated	to	the	
final	exam	per	the	formula	above.	There	are	no	“make-up”	exams.		
	

Final	Exam:	The	final	exam	has	been	scheduled	by	the	registrar	for	9am12pm	on	Monday,	May	1.	This	date	is	fixed	and	will	not	change.	If	you	miss	
the	final,	you	will	not	receive	credit	for	the	class.	Do	not	register	for	this	
course	if	you	will	be	unable	to	take	the	final	at	the	scheduled	time	(e.g.,	due	to	
airline	tickets,	summer	internships,	or	for	any	other	reason).	If	a	student	is	
excused	from	the	exam	by	an	academic	dean	due	to	illness	or	some	other	
extreme	circumstance,	the	policy	for	Economics	201	is	that	the	student	
would	then	take	the	final	exam	being	offered	for	the	same	class	in	the	
following	semester.	

	
Assignments:	I	will	be	assigning	weekly	problem	sets	during	this	course.	
These	assignments	will	include	two	parts:	completion	of	“Aplia	Homework”	
assigned	within	MindTap	and	submission	of	end	of	chapter	exercises	on	
Sakai.	Assignments	will	be	posted	on	Sakai	and	will	typically	be	due	on	
Wednesdays	before	that	start	of	class.	Late	assignments	will	not	be	
accepted.	However,	I	will	drop	the	lowest	two	homework	scores	when	
determining	the	overall	grade.	Details	about	the	grading	of	each	part	of	the	
assignments:	
	
• MindTap	exercises	will	be	graded	for	credit	and	together	with	
attendance	will	count	for	10%	of	your	grade.	
• End	of	chapter	exercises	will	not	be	looked	at	until	the	end	of	the	term.	
At	that	time,	we	will	look	at	the	assignments	of	those	whose	course	
grade	(excluding	assignments)	is	close	to	the	borderline	of	a	higher	
grade.	If	end	of	chapter	problems	were	handed	in	consistently	and	the	
quality	of	the	work	was	good,	we	will	then	adjust	grades	for	students	
who	are	close	to	a	higher	grade	upward.	
	

Note	that	assignments	are	designed	to	give	you	a	hands-on	perspective	on	
the	material	as	well	as	practice	for	exams.	The	best	way	to	learn	economics	is	
to	practice	using	the	techniques!	You	are	permitted—and	even	encouraged—
to	collaborate	with	other	students	on	assignments,	especially	if	you	get	stuck.	
However,	each	student	must	submit	his	or	her	own	copy	of	the	assignment.	
	
Attendance:	Class	attendance	will	be	tracked	using	the	Arkaive	app	
(instructions	will	be	posted	in	the	coming	week)	and	together	with	MindTap	
assignments	will	account	for	10%	of	your	grade.	
	

	
Grading	(and	Re-Grading)	of	Exams	
	
What	I	want	you	to	learn	in	this	course	is	how	to	apply	the	methodology	of	
economics	to	a	wide	variety	of	problems/situations.	Therefore,	your	exam	grades	
will	depend	at	least	as	much	on	the	strength	of	your	reasoning	as	on	the	bottom-line	
answers	you	give.	You	should	write	out	a	careful	explanation	for	all	your	answers.		
	
Grade	Disputes:	Grade	disputes	impose	a	significant	cost	in	terms	of	time	and	
energy.	The	best	way	to	avoid	them	is	to	answer	questions	clearly	and	
concisely.	Vague	or	ambiguous	answers	will	typically	lead	to	a	low	grade.	
That	said,	if	you	think	that	an	exam	has	been	graded	incorrectly,	it	is	possible	
to	petition	for	a	re-grading	of	the	exam.	The	petition	must	be	typed	and	
submitted	to	the	Head	TA	in	writing—by	email—within	24	hours	of	receiving	
the	graded	exam.	The	HTA	decides	whether	or	not	to	accept	the	petition.	If	
the	petition	is	accepted,	the	entire	exam	will	be	re-graded	(not	just	one	
particular	question),	which	could	ultimately	result	in	either	a	higher	or	lower	
total	score.	A	student	must	submit	this	petition	for	any	re-grading,	including	
the	case	where	the	points	were	not	added	up	correctly.	
	
	
Other	Policies	and	Guidelines	
	
Computers	and	Cell	Phones: Use	of	cell	phones,	tablets,	and	computers	are	not	
permitted	during	the	lectures.	These	devices	can	cause	a	distraction	to	your	
fellow	students	(and	yourselves).	Also,	please	make	sure	you	have	your	
phone	silenced	in	class.	
	
Academic	Conduct: It	goes	without	saying	that	academic	misconduct	will	not	
be	tolerated.	Students	are	expected	to	uphold	the	Duke	Community	Standard:	
https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-communitystandard	
Note	that	neither	calculators	nor	cell	phones	can	be	used	in	any	fashion	
during	exams.	Plan	to	use	a	wristwatch	rather	than	a	cell	phone	if	you	wish	to	
monitor	the	time.	
	
Students	with	Disabilities:	Students	with	disabilities	who	believe	they	may	
need	accommodations	in	this	class	are	encouraged	to	contact	the	Student	
Disability	Access	Office	at	(919)	668-1267	as	soon	as	possible	to	better	
ensure	that	such	accommodations	can	be	implemented	in	a	timely	fashion.	
Please	also	inform	me	of	any	exam	accommodations	within	the	first	two	
weeks	of	class.	All	discussions	will	remain	confidential.	
	
Difficulties	Completing	Coursework:	Be	sure	to	contact	your	academic	dean	if	
you	have	any	issues	that	will	interfere	with	your	completion	of	coursework	
or	the	final	exam.	Instructors	are	not	permitted	to	directly	adjust	a	student’s	

course	grades	due	to	difficulties	faced	by	the	student.	Such	matters	must	be	
handled	by	a	student’s	academic	dean.
