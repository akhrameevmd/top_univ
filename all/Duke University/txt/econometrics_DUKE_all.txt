Econ 208D: INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMETRICS
Econometrics is the application of mathematical and statistical techniques to economic data. Econometrics
attempts to do more than simply document an association between two variables (e.g., people with more
years of education, on average, have higher incomes than those with less). It attempts to estimate the causal
effect of a variable of interest on the outcome (e.g., if an individual acquires an additional year of
education, she will have a higher income, on average). Finally, econometrics also attempts to quantify the
degree of accuracy of the estimated causal effect. In other words, hypotheses are formulated and tested.
This course will introduce you to the basic econometrics toolkit. We begin with a review of some
probability and statistics material that you should have seen in previous coursework. We then turn to the
notion of causality, and explore the extent to which randomized control trials can establish it under certain
conditions. Although randomized experiments, in society and in classroom “laboratories,” are now
common, economics is still primarily a non-experimental science, unlike some natural sciences. That is, for
many questions of interest, it is not feasible, or ethical, to control scientifically who gets a treatment (say,
an extra year of education) and who does not. Therefore, the majority of the class will then be spent on
learning what how to establish and measure causal effects in data not generated by a randomized
experiment.
This course is deeply linked to the other economics courses you have and will continue to take as at its
core, it is the course that teaches the methods to measure and evaluate economic models. Econometrics
requires developing and implementing a wide skill set: mathematics, statistics, economic theory, computer
programming, writing, and (not least of all) intuitive sense. Be prepared for an engaging and rigorous
semester.
Lectures: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:05AM-11:20AM, Social Sciences 139.
Discussion Sections: There are six discussion sections. You have each been assigned to one. The purpose
of these discussion sections is to (i) answer any of your questions from class, (ii) go over problem sets and
midterms, (iii) do additional problems to increase your understanding of class material, and (iv) give help
with STATA (see below for more on this).
Attendance: You are not required to attend either lectures or discussion sections. You are almost done with
your basic formal education, so at this point you have hopefully figured out how to manage your time
appropriately to achieve your goals. But be forewarned, attendance at both lectures and discussion sections
is highly recommended. The class is hard. Do yourself a favor and make the proper investments so that you
can have a fulfilling semester. I also cannot rule out the possibility that I will, from time to time, give popquizzes in class. If absent, your grade on any such quiz will be a zero.
Teaching Assistants: We have Teaching Assistants for the course. All are economics PhD students here at
Duke. These teaching assistants will run the discussion sections and have their own office hours.
1. Roman Levkin, Head TA (romanlevkin@gmail.com)
2. Rui Chen (rui.chen@duke.edu)
3. Zachary Nolan (zach.nolan@duke.edu)
4. Daniel Garrett (daniel.garrett@duke.edu)
Office Hours: My office hours - Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11:30AM-12:30PM, Social Sciences 228A. The
TAs will also hold office hours shown in the weekly class calendar below.

Grad Lounge

*Grad Lounge is a common area on the third floor of the Social Sciences Building. Please, proceed to the third floor and turn to the
left as you exit the staircase. Grad Lounge is in the end of the hallway (in the North-Eastern wing of the building). 

Sakai: I will use Sakai to distribute class materials like lecture slides and problem sets. It is your
responsibility to see that you can log on to Sakai to access the course site.
Text: To try to save you a little $ I am only requiring that you buy the online version of Stock and Watson
3e. It is available from the bookstore. To help familiarize you with the online version of the textbook, a
representative from Pearson will attend the first day of class to walk you through the course website. If you
have a hard copy of the book that should be fine as well. Just make sure it is the correct edition.
Slides: I will post lecture slides after each lecture. Thus, you won’t have all the formulas written down for
you in class as would be the case if I posted slides before class. That should tell you something –
memorizing formulas is not important for this class. Understanding them is. So you can decide how you
want to take notes for this course, but I would suggest focusing on making sure you understand the intuition
and processes we appeal to and use, not memorizing facts and formulas.
Policy Re Technology in Class: Cellphones are not permitted in class. If you have to take a call during
class then you may excuse yourself and take the call outside. Computers, tablets, etc. are not permitted in
class. Get out the old pen and paper. I promise: shutting this stuff off for (not even) an hour and a half twice
per week will feel good and do wonders for your mind.
STATA: All problem sets will require you to use a statistical software program called STATA. To help you
with this program we will have a representative from Duke’s Data and Visualization Services group give a
short tutorial on the program in class during one of the first classes of the semester. The TAs will also go
over how to use STATA in the discussion sections. The installation instructions for STATA can be found at:
https://public.econ.duke.edu/stata. Here is some more useful information:

Grading: Evaluation will be based on six problem sets, two midterm exams, a final exam and class
participation. The problem sets are due at the beginning of class (must be turned in within 5 minutes of
class starting) on the day they are due. Midterms and Exams must be turned in at the end of the class in
which they are given. If they aren’t turned in within 5 minutes of class officially ending the grade on that
midterm or final may lowered as a result.
The final grade for person i will be determined as follows:
Final Gradei = 0.05CPi + 0.20AVGTOP4PSi + 0.25BESTMTi + 0.50FINALi
where: CP is class participation score, AVGTOP4PS is the average of the best four out of six problem sets,
BESTMT is the best of two midterm grades, and FINAL is the grade on the final exam.
So you’ll note that you can drop the lowest two problem set grades, and the lowest midterm grade.
Due Dates:
• Problem Sets (all due at the beginning of class on the following days)
1. 1/28/16
2. 2/25/16
3. 3/3/16
4. 3/24/16
5. 4/14/16
6. 4/21/16
• Midterms (taken in class on the following days)
1. 2/16/16
2. 3/29/16
• Final Exam (7:00-10:00PM, Room TBD, on the following day)
1. 5/3/16
Re-grading: any requests for a re-grade must be made after 2 days but before 5 days have passed since the
graded item was returned to you. All re-grade requests should be made in person to the Head TA (see
above for who that is). The Head TA has the full authority to grant or deny re-grade requests. If the Head
TA grants a re-grade request, the entire document will be re-graded, even if this means that the item being
re-graded ends up with a lower grade than it started with.
Late Work: Anything turned in late, as defined above, receives a 0. There are no opportunities to re-take
tests or turn in problem sets late since you are allowed to drop some of these. If you miss the final exam,
then you can take the final exam offered by whomever teaches this course next semester. We can go over
the nuances of this procedure if the need arises, which hopefully it will not.
Special Needs: If you require extra time or have special needs it is your responsibility to let me know at
least two weeks in advance of any graded item’s due date. Do not rely on Duke’s own internal procedures
for letting me know this stuff. Those procedures may work fine, but you are responsible to make sure I
know about such needs or issues.
Honor Code: I take the honor code very seriously and I expect you all to as well. I expect all students to
adhere to the Duke Community Standard, repeated here in order to refresh your memory:
“Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and
to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability. Citizens of this
community commit to reflect upon and uphold these principles in all academic and
nonacademic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.
To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
• I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
• I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
• I will act if the Standard is compromised.”
