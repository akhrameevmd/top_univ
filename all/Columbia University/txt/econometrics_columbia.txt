ECON GU4413 Econometrics of Time Series and Forecasting.
Prerequisites: W3211, W3213, W3412.
Corequisites: MATH V2010.

This course focuses on the application of econometric methods to time series data; such data is common in the testing of macro and financial economics models. 
It will focus on the application of these methods to data problems in macro and finance.
