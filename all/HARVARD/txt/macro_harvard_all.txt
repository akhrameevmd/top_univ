COURSE DESCRIPTION: This course will teach students the basic tools of macroeconomics
and apply them to real world economic policy. The goals of the course are for students to
(a) understand how to evaluate macroeconomic conditions such as unemployment, inflation, and
growth (b) understand how monetary policy and fiscal policy can be used to influence short-run
macroeconomic conditions (c) understand media accounts of macroeconomic events. The course
will cover a broad range of topics in macroeconomic policy. Examples of issues to be discussed
include the role of fiscal and monetary policies in stabilizing the economy, the relationship
between inflation and unemployment, the role of government policy in promoting long-term
economic growth, monetary and fiscal policies in an open economy, European Monetary Union,
deficits, and stabilization and reform.
The course will be structured around the tools (models) of macroeconomics, using primarily
graphs, and occasionally equations. However, motivation for these tools, and examples of their
use will always be taken from current and recent real-world macroeconomics events and
conditions.
AUDIENCE: This course is intended for students who are interested in learning and applying
macroeconomic models of the economy to addressing current issues in macroeconomic policy.
Previous exposure to economics at the level of API-101 is recommended.
REQUIREMENTS:
Students will be expected to prepare assigned readings before class.
Students will be assigned problem sets throughout the course in order both to reinforce the use of
tools for policy analysis and to expand the issues analyzed beyond those in the classroom. Late
problem sets will receive only half credit, and under no circumstances will use of distributed
answers be acceptable. Students are encouraged to work in small groups (2-3 students), but each
student must write up his or her answers separately, and must indicate the names of other
members of the study group on the assignment. All assignment grades count; in this course the
lowest assignment grade is NOT dropped.

In addition, there will be a midterm and a final exam, both closed-book.
Course grades will be based on these types of assignments as follows: Problem Sets: 30%,
Midterm: 30%, Final Exam: 40%.

MATERIALS: Readings will come primarily from a text, Macroeconomics, Fifth Edition, by N.
Gregory Mankiw, New York:Worth Publishers, 2002. If students have access to an earlier edition
of this book and do not want to purchase the fifth edition, that is fine. I can provide comparable
chapter numbers for earlier versions to assist you. The text is available at the Coop. Due to the
cost, I have listed it as "recommended" at the Coop, and have provided as many copies as possible
to the KSG library. I do expect that you will do the readings from the text, but I do not expect that
everyone will purchase the text.
Other than this book, the course will use a collection of other required readings, most of which
will be available electronically from the course pages. Readings will include discussions of
economic policy by government policymakers, non-government economists, and the press. In
addition, copies of optional readings, which go into further depth on some topics, will be available
in a packet on reserve in the KSG library.
In addition, students will be assigned readings from current periodicals, as they become available.
Students are strongly encouraged to keep up-to-date with current macroeconomic events with a
periodical such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, or another
periodical with frequent coverage of economics news. These are all available online and in the
KSG library.
