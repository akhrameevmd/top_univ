Course	Description:	
	
We	analyze	the	linear	model	as	a	tool	for	describing	relationships	in	economic	data	and	
associated	disciplined.	In	particular,	we	will	focus	on	best	linear	predictors	under	square	
loss	and	analyze	this	prediction	problem	in	details	using	cross	sectional	data.	We	discuss	
nonlinear	models	and	their	approximations	using	linear	models.	Topics	include:	multiple	
regression,	instrumental	variables	regression,	analysis	of	random	experiments	and	
quasi-experiments,	and	regression	with	time	series	data.		Students	will	learn	how	to	
conduct	and	critique	empirical	studies.	The	course	gives	sufficient	details	on	the	theory	
but	will	focus	on	applications.	Prerequisite:	Statistics	104	or	equivalent.	
	
Textbook:		
The	textbook	is:		
	
J.H.	Stock	and	M.W.	Watson,	Introduction	to	Econometrics	(third	edition	update),	
Addison-Wesley,	2015.		
	
Earlier	editions	and	all	international	editions	printed	in	English	are	acceptable.	An	
optional	book	that	is	complementary	is

Lecture	slides	(if	used)	will	be	posted	on	the	course	Web	site	by	9pm	the	day	before	
lecture.	
	
Problem	Sets	
	
There	will	be	weekly	problem	sets.	Some	of	the	problems	will	be	computer	based.	The	
course	statistical	software	is	STATA,	which	is	available	for	download	from	FAS	IT.	
Problem	sets	and	data	will	be	posted	on	the	course	Web	page.	Please	hand	in	your	
homework	assignments	at	the	beginning	of	class	the	day	they	are	due.		Assignments	
handed	in	after	this,	but	before	answers	are	posted	will	be	marked	down	by	50%.	
Assignments	handed	in	after	the	solutions	are	posted	will	receive	no	credit.	Assignments	
will	generally	be	posted	on	Thursdays	to	be	turned	in	the	following	Thursday.		
	
Students	are	encouraged	to	work	in	groups	on	their	problem	sets,	but	each	student	
must	write	up	his	or	her	answers	separately.	Please	append	your	STATA	“log”	files	to	
your	assignments.	
	
Grading,	etc	
	
Problem	Sets:	30%;	Midterm	Exam:	25%;	Final	Exam:	45%.		In	computing	your	total	problem	set	
grade,	the	lowest	grade	out	of	problem	sets	will	be	dropped.		For	both	exams,	you	will	be	
permitted	to	bring	in	a	single	(two-sided)	8½x11	sheet	of	notes	and	a	calculator;	no	textbooks,	
computers,	cell	phones,	etc.		The	spring	and	fall	semesters	of	this	course	are	graded	using	the	
same	curve.	The	midterm	exam	will	be	held	in	class	on	Tuesday	October	10th.	There	will	be	no	
midterm	retakes	allowed,	so	please	plan	accordingly.	Also,	the	final	will	be	held	at	a	time	
specified	by	the	registrar’s	office.	
	
	
Various	tidbits,…	
	
Generally,	I	like	talking	to	students	in	office	hours	and	encourage	you	to	show	up	(and	show	
up	early	as	my	office	hours	end	sharply	at	the	end	of	the	designated	time).	Also,	drop	by	early	
in	the	semester,	and	introduce	yourself	–no	need	for	a	particular	question.	Please	make	sure	
that	if	you	have	a	set	of	questions	or	need	extra	help	you	should	try	your	best	to	show	up	
early	at	office	hours.	Coming	in	with	many	questions	5	minutes	before	the	end	of	office	hours	
is	not	encouraged.	Also,	contact	the	TFs,	as	they	are	a	great	asset	to	you.	Keep	your	email	
questions	to	ones	that	require	quick	answers	such	as	fixing	typos,	etc.	Long	serious	questions	
like	``why	linear	models’’	require	serious	answers	that	cannot	be	done	via	email.	Most	
importantly,	if	you	are	not	catching	up	with	the	class	(for	whatever	reason),	get	help	and	get	
help	early.		
Finally,	all	communications	will	be	done	via	the	class	website	with	occasional	emails.	Please	
make	sure	you	check	the	website,	and	check	it	often.
