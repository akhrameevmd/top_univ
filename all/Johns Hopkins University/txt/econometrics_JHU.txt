180.334 Econometrics
Introduction to the methods of estimation in economic research. The first part of the course develops the primary method employed in economic research, 
the method of least squares. This is followed by an investigation of the performance of the method in a variety of important situations. 
The development of a way to handle many of the situations in which ordinary least squares is not useful, the method of instrumental variables, concludes the course.

180.434 Advanced Econometrics
This is a faster-paced and more intensive version of Econometrics 180.334. You can use either 180.334 or 180.434 to satisfy the requirement for the economics major.
 This course is suitable for those students who prefer a more technical treatment of econometric methodologies. Both 180.334 and 180.434 will be offered during the same time slot, so the logistics of switching from 180.334 to 180.434
 should be seamless, should you decide to make the switch. NOTE: you may not take both 180.334 and 180.434.

Prerequisites:

Students may only receive credit for either AS.180.334 or AS.180.434.;AS.180.301, one semester of linear algebra, one semester of calculus, AS.280.345 or EN.553.211 or EN.553.111 or EN.553.310 or EN.553.311 or EN.553.420 or EN.560.435.
