Overview
This course introduces ways to harness data to answer questions of social and intellectual interests.
It combines tools used in a variety of fields (economics, statistics, machine learning, business) for
a variety of goals (description/visualization, causal evaluation, and prediction with and without
policy changes). This course aims for students to understand and critically discuss:
1) Econometric, statistical, and machine learning methods

1

2) Computational/algorithmic implementations of methods in programming languages (like
Matlab, Python, R, and/or Stata)
3) Key applications (from a variety of domains like brain and cognitive sciences, education,
development, health, industrial organization, labor, linguistics, marketing, politics, public
finance, trade; see the bold questions in the following Roadmap)
Students will understand not only how methods work in theory but will also replicate and extend
empirical applications by working with data by themselves.
Students will finish the course equipped with a workman’s familiarity with the tools of data
science, facility with data handling and statistical programming, and—hopefully—a good
understanding of what questions you want to answer and how best to do it. That’s a lot of ground
to cover, so plan your time accordingly and be prepared to spend many hours every week.
Prerequisites
Students should be familiar with basic concepts in every one of probability, statistics, algebra, and
calculus. I strongly suggest students to take econ 131 before this 132 course. Students not already
proficient in a statistical programming language like Python, R, Stata, or Matlab will be required
to learn and use a language in the first few weeks of the semester. You can find a list of code and
data resources at the end of this syllabus.
Requirements and Grades
Five problem sets (mix of mathematical, programming, and empirical exercises): 40%
Midterm (closed-book): 30%
Final (closed-book): 30%
You are also asked to do a few hours of reading and “watching” (videos, podcasts, etc.) distributed
every week. Their content will be asked for in problem sets and exams.

Resources on Programming Languages
Any of the following four languages is appropriate for this course. Python and R are for free, but
Matlab and Stata are not. Please speak to me or the TA if you would like advice on which to use.
CodeAcademy, DataCamp, Coursera, EdX, and Lynda.com have good resources on some or all of
these languages.
