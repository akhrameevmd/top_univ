Economics 116a
Fall 2017
This course is an introduction to macroeconomics. Introductory microeconomics is a prerequisite. The text is Case, Fair, and Oster, Principles of
Macroeconomics, twelfth edition, which is available at the Yale book store.
Additional readings and material will be posted on the class website during the
course of the semester. You should read each day the macro news of the day.
The class website is fairmodel.econ.yale.edu.
Course requirements are weekly problem sets, a midterm, and a final exam.
The problem sets will be graded and will count for 20% of the final grade. The
midterm exam will be given during class time and is scheduled for Tuesday,
OCTOBER 17. It will count for 30% of the final grade. The final exam will count
for 50% of the final grade. The final exam is administered by Yale College.
Part of the problem sets will have you working with a macroeconometric
model of the U.S. economy. This model is on the class website. You will be asked
to do policy and forecasting experiments using the model.
The main aim of the course is to provide you with a good understanding of
how the macroeconomy works. There is a mixture of theory and application of
the theory to current economic events.
