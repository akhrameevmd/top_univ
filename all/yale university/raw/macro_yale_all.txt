Prerequisites:   Economics 121 requires a course in introductory microeconomics, either Economics 110 or 115, and the prior completion of a course in mathematics at the level of single-variable calculus or higher, typically Math 112, 115, 118 or 120. 

Discussion Sections:  Discussion sections will meet weekly, beginning Thursday, September 7.   You will register for sections using the discussion section preference selection tool.  You may register your section preference beginning Wednesday, August 30, at 9:00 am.  Registration closes at 9:00 am on Monday, September 4.  You can expect be notified of your section placement by 9:00 am on Tuesday, September 5.  If you do not register before closing, you will need to go to OCS (online course selection), beginning Wednesday, September 6.

Texts:   You need not purchase a text for this class--textbook prices are too outrageously high (look here and here for more on this) for instructors to require  texts in good conscience.  If you prefer a text, I recommend: 
Walter Nicholson and Christopher Snyder, Microeconomic Theory: Basic Principles and Extensions (Thomson/South-Western, 12th edition, 2016). 
The notes for each lecture will indicate the relevant readings in this text.  The text can be a good reference, but the class will be self contained and the text is not necessary. 

Requirements:   Grades will be based on: 

25%:        Mid-term exam I:  Thursday, September 28 (in class)
25%:        Mid-term exam II:  Thursday, November 2 (in class)
20%:        Problem sets
30%:        Final exam:   Thursday, December 14, 7:00 pm (location TBA).

When computing the average problem set score to enter your grade, your lowest individual score will be dropped.  The distribution of grades in this class will be approximately the following. 

A and A- (50%, of which about 1/3 will be A) 
B (45%, most of which will be straight B grades, with a few B- and B+) 
C and lower, and withdrawals after the first midterm (5%, with grades lower than C being rare). 
 
If you have questions about exam grading, you should first compare your answer to the posted solution.  If you would like a score to be reconsidered, your next step is to give your exam and a written request, explaining why you think reconsideration is appropriate, to your TA. Such requests must be confined to a single question.  In order to consider all such requests together and in a timely manner, requests must be submitted by the end of the week following that in which exams are returned.  Adjustments in partial credit are typically not made.  If an adjustment is made, the exam may be referred to an independent grader, who will review the question and assign a replacement grade that may be higher or lower than the original, and then will check whether other questions on the exam also warrant reconsideration.

Problem Sets:  Problem sets and their due dates are listed in the schedule below.  Late problem sets will not be accepted.  (The ability to drop your lowest score gives you protection against accidents.)  In particular, problem sets must be received in class by the end of lecture on the day the problem set is due.  Under the appropriate circumstances, including a Dean’s excuse, you may be excused from a problem set, in which case that problem set will also be dropped from your grade (in addition to your lowest score) and the weight placed on you other problem sets expanded appropriately.  

Problem sets will be graded roughly, taking into account whether answers are complete, correct, and well presented, to give you an idea of whether you have a good command of the material (a score of 10 our of 10), are on the right track but have some difficulties (a score of 8), or have some fundamental difficulties (a score of 6 or below) (with scores of 7 and 9 for borderline cases).  For more detailed feedback you can compare your solutions to those posted.  Problem set grades are not reconsidered.

Tutoring:  For those who would like some extra help, there are several possibilities. 

First, the Residential College Math/Science Tutors offer drop-in tutoring, and include tutors (Xiaochuan Xing (Benjamin Franklin College, Sunday, 7:00-9:00 pm), )Charles Cai (Silliman College, Sunday 8:00-10:00 pm and Wednesday, 9:00-11:00 pm), Satoshi Matsuzawa (Center for Teaching and Learning, Tuesday, 7:00-9:00 pm,Trumbull College, Thursday, 7:00-9:00 pm)) happy to help with Economics.  Note that you need not be a member of one of these colleges in order to meet with these tutors.

Second, we now have three Course-Based Peer Tutors.  These tutors will hold the following office hours:
            Justin Katz: 3:00-5:00 pm Monday, WLH 204.
            Hui Yang: 7:00-9:00 pm Monday, WLH 205. 
            Justin Young: 1:30 -4:00 pm  Friday, WTS A32. 
You may also email them to raise questions and request individual appointments, which (time permitting) they will arrange. 

In addition, each week (as long as someone attends) there will be an extra drop-in discussion session, hosted by Justin Katz and open to anyone who would like to go over some of the material again, on Thursdays, 9:00-9:50 pm, WLH 001.  Make use of this as an extra opportunity to see some material again, ask questions, or catch up on things you've missed.

Third, you can fill out a Science and QR Tutor Request form to request a tutor.
