 Topics in Macroeconomics (ECNM10069)
Summary

development of some important topics in macroeconomic
analysis at a more advanced level than that of standard
intermediate courses. It thus extends and deepens the
work of Economics 1 and Economics 2, bridging the gap
between intermediate and graduate level courses in
economics, and providing insight into some recent areas
of economic research activity. Throughout there is an
emphasis on the application of economic principles.
The course has a mathematical content and knowledge of
calculus is assumed.
