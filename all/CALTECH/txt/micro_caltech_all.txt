Ec 11. Introduction to Economics. 9 units (3-2-4); first, second terms. An
introduction to economic methodology, models, and institutions. Includes
both basic microeconomics and an introduction to modern approaches to
macroeconomic issues. Students are required to participate in economics
experiments. Instructors: Plott, Rangel.

Ec 105. Industrial Organization. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Prerequisites:
Ec 11 or equivalent. A study of how technology affects issues of
market structure and how market structure affects observable economic
outcomes, such as prices, profits, advertising, and research and development
expenditures. Emphasis will be on how the analytic tools
developed in the course can be used to examine particular industries—
especially those related to internet commerce—in detail. Each student is
expected to write one substantial paper. Not offered 2016–17.
