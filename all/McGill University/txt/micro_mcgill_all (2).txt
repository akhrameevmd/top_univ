A: Course Content
This 3-credit Microeconomics course focuses on the behaviour of individual economic units (individual markets, individual
consumers, and individual firms). It examines the choices that consumers and firms face, how different market structures
respond to these choices, and when/how/why government intervention may or may not be desirable for society as a whole. At
each stage you will do some theory and then use it for a variety of applications. I hope you will be surprised to find that some
things you think seem obvious in everyday life turn out to be anything but! The course assumes you have no prior knowledge of
economics.
.
Do the readings as the lectures progress - economic reasoning builds upon itself, so you need to understand each part as we go
along. If you must miss a lecture or conference, arrange a 'buddy system' so you can copy the notes of someone who does attend.
Some examinable material covered in lectures may not be in the text. Lecture notes will not be posted on the myCourses web
site.
B: Text & Learning Tools
The text is Microeconomics, 15th Canadian Edition, by Ragan (published by Person Canada) available from Paragraphe
bookstore, 2220 McGill College Avenue. [**Make sure you get the MICRO, not the Macro.]
The text comes with access to an online site (MyEconLab), where you will find (i) explanations for a selection of end-of-chapter
text exercises/questions, (ii) some short practice quizzes, (iii) sections on the Additional Topics referred to in the text, and more.
Also available is the Study Guide to the 14th edition of the text (by Dickinson & Indart) which has brief summaries of chapter
topics, useful study hints, and lots of practice questions and answers (with explanations). It includes multiple-choice questions,
short-answer questions and longer exercises to help understand the material.
A very important learning tool is the myCourses website accessed through the McGill website. This is specific to Econ208-004
and you should regularly check it for course announcements, additional readings, conference sheets (questions and answer
guides), and other items to assist you in the course. You can also use it to ask questions of and receive answers from your fellow
students.
C: Contacting Me
My office hours (times to be determined) are in Leacock 516. If you can’t make my office hours because of your course
schedule, email a request (paul.dickinson@mcgill.ca) to arrange a mutually convenient time and include (i) your weekly
schedule and (ii) a brief explanation of what you need to talk about. Use email, not the ‘phone.
D: Conferences
Your Teaching Assistants, M. Jean-Louis Bernard Menard (and others to be assigned), hold weekly ‘conferences’ (small-group
seminars) to help you understand assigned questions & topics on ‘conference sheets’ and answer your questions about lectures
and readings. Conference sheets aim at a further understanding of the lecture/text material and its applications. The sheet
questions and basic answer guides will be posted each week on myCourses. Try them yourself before you go to conferences.
Conferences are expected to start in the week beginning Monday January 16 or Monday January 23 – you will be notified.
Conference times, and the conference rooms, and TA office hours, will be posted on myCourses.

E: Grading/Examinations/Conduct
There will be a mid-term exam worth 30% (expected to be on Thursday February 23) and a cumulative 3-hour final worth
70% (held during the final examination period as determined by the Faculty of Arts). If your performance on the final is
better than that on the midterm the weightings will be 20%/80%. It is anticipated that the exams will be multiple-choice,
'though I reserve the right to include some short-answer questions at my discretion. They are "closed book" examinations no texts, notes, cell phones or electronic memory devices allowed. The course grades may be curved at my discretion.
There is NO deferred examination for the mid-term. If you miss the mid-term, the final will count as 100% of the course
mark only in cases where students can’t attend the mid-term for justifiable reasons, as determined by the instructor and
subject to written confirmation deemed acceptable to the instructor. Students missing the mid-term without instructor
approval will get a mark of zero for that exam.

Text Packages and Prices
The following print packages are available at Paragraphe bookstore.

$149.95 for a bound version of the Ragan 15th edition text with MyEconLab
$169.95 for a package containing a bound Ragan 15th edition text with MyEconLab, and 14th edition Study Guide
$45.0 for the 14th edition Study Guide.
$95 for the loose-leaf Ragan 15th edition text with MyEconLab
$115 for a package with a loose-leaf Ragan 15th edition text with MyEconLab, and with 14th edition Study Guide

The following are available online. They can’t be downloaded,

$90 for e-text with MyEconLab – but what you get depends on where you buy it.
o If you buy the MyEconLab at Paragraphe you get a free Study Guide with it. Access to the MyEconLab
component expires in 12 months.
o If you don’t buy it from Paragraphe – i.e. you go directly online – then you don’t get the Study Guide.
$74.97 for e-text alone, with no additions. This is available from VitalSource and access expires in 12 months.

Because economics ‘builds upon itself’ you’ll often need to return to previous pages for a refresher. For me (and you may have a
different opinion) this is easier with a print copy than with e-text because the latter shows only one page at a time, so it’s harder
to ‘flip back’. For those preferring print, the $115 package is a good deal.
