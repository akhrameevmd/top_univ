Overview
The course provides a detailed introduction to Macroeconomics and encompasses the fundamentals of
Macroeconomics. On completion of the course students will have the ability to critically assess real world
macroeconomic developments at the 1st year undergraduate level. Moreover, students will be able to better
understand the material in other online economics courses such as the ‘New Economic Powers'and
‘Globalisation’.
Listen to Dr Sangaralingam Ramesh talking about the course:

The global credit crunch of 2007-2008 has had significant implications for the lives of many people around the
world. This short course aims to provide students with an understanding of conventional macroeconomic thinking
so that they can understand the essential principles of how the macroeconomy of nation states functions in a
globalised world. Once students have completed this course they will be better placed to understand the causes
of inflation and unemployment and the relevance of government monetary and fiscal policy in dealing with such
economic problems. Therefore, students will be able to use the knowledge gained to understand everyday
macroeconomic events. Furthermore, students will have a solid foundation upon which they can progress to
higher level studies in Macroeconomics as well as being able to apply the knowledge gained to other online
courses such as ‘Globalisation'and the ‘New Economic Powers’.
