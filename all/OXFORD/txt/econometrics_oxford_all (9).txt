Spurious Regressions
I

Spurious regressions have a long tradition in statistics

I

Yule (1926): “Why do we sometimes get
nonsense-correlations between time-series?”

I

“It is fairly familiar knowledge that we sometimes obtain
between quantities varying with the time (time-variables) quite
high correlations to which we cannot attach any physical
significance whatever, although under the ordinary test the
correlation would be held to be certainly "significant"”

Spurious Regressions
I

Real Data Example: Yule (1926)

I

Proportion of Church of England marriages to all
marriages for the years 1866-1911 inclusive and
standardized mortality per 1000 persons for the same years

I

Correlation coefficient = 0.9512

Spurious Regression
I

“As the occurrence of such “nonsense-correlations” makes one
mistrust the serious arguments that are sometimes put forward
on the basis of correlations between time series (...) it is
important to clear up the problem how they arise and in what
special cases.” Yule (1926)

I

“When we find that a theoretical formula applied to a particular
case gives results which common sense judges to be incorrect, it
is generally as well to examine the particular assumptions
from which it was deduced, and see which of them are
inapplicable to the case in point.” Yule (1926)

Spurious Regressions
I

Yule (1926): Experimental exercise

I

He simulated the distribution of the empirical correlation
coefficient calculated from two independent i.i.d.
processes, from two independent random walks, and from
two independent cumulated random walks

Spurious Regressions
I

Granger and Newbold (1974): “Spurious Regressions in
Econometrics”

I

“It is very common to see reported in applied econometric
literature time series regression equations with an apparently
high degree of fit, measured by the coefficient of multiple
correlation R2 or the corrected coefficient R̄2 , but with an
extremely low value for the Durbin-Watson statistic.”

I

How nonsense regressions can arise? A simulation study:

I

Let yt = yt 1 + vt and xt = xt 1 + wt with y0 = 0, x0 = 0,
and vt i.i.d. (0, 1) independent of wt i.i.d. (0, 1) and
consider the least squares regression
yt = α̂ + β̂xt + ût , t = 1, ..., T

Spurious Regressions

I

Phillips (1986): “Understanding Spurious Regressions in
Econometrics”

I

“The present paper develops an asymptotic theory for
regressions that relate quite general integrated random processes.
This includes spurious regressions of the Granger-Newbold
type as a special case. It turns out that the correct asymptotic
theory goes a long way towards explaining the experimental
results that these authors obtained. In many cases their findings
are quite predictable from the true asymptotic behavior of the
relevant statistics.”

Spurious Regressions
I

“Thus, our theory demonstrate that in the Granger-Newbold
regressions of independent random walks the usual t-ratio
significance test does not possess a limiting distribution, but
actually diverges as the sample size T ! ∞.”

I

“Inevitably, therefore, the bias in this test towards the rejection
of no relationship (based on a nominal critical value of 1.96) will
increase with T.”

I

“We also show that the Durbin-Watson statistic actually
converges in probability to zero, while the regression R2 has a
non-degenerate limiting distribution as T ! ∞.”

Spurious Regressions

Let yt = yt 1 + vt and xt = xt 1 + wt with y0 = 0, x0 = 0, and
vt i.i.d. (0, 1) independent of wt i.i.d. (0, 1) and consider the
least squares regression
yt = β̂xt + ût , t = 1, ..., T
where

Multivariate Time Series

Co-integration

Integration
Definition (I (d))
A series with no deterministic components which has a
stationary, invertible, ARMA representation after differencing d
times, is said to be integrated of order d, denoted xt I (d).

I

In this course, only the values d = 0 and d = 1 will be
considered (e.g. random walk), but many results can be
generalized to other cases including the fractional
difference model

I

Substantial differences between xt
(Random walk!)

I (0) and xt

I (1).

Integration

Properties of xt

I (0) (with zero mean):

(i) var(xt ) is finite
(ii) innovations have only temporary effect on xt
(iii) autocorrelations, ρk , decrease steadily in magnitude for
large enough k, so sum is finite

Integration

Properties of xt

I (1) (x0 = 0):

(i) var(xt ) goes to infinity as t goes to infinity
(ii) innovations have permanent effect on xt
(iii) autocorrelations, ρk ! 1 for all k as t ! ∞

Co-integration

I

If xt and yt are both I (d), then it is “generally” true that the
linear combination
zt = xt

ayt ,

will also be I (d)

I

David Hendry said to Clive Granger: The difference of two
I (1) variables can be I (0)...

Co-integration
Engle, R. F. and C. W. J. Granger (1987): “Co-integration and
Error Correction: Representation Estimation and Testing,”
Econometrica 55, 251-276.

Definition (Co-integration)
The components of the vector xt are said to be co-integrated of
order d, b, denoted xt CI (d, b), if (i) all components of xt are
I (d); (ii) there exists a vector α (6= 0) so that
zt = α0 xt I (d b), b > 0. The vector α is called the
co-integrating vector

Co-integration
I

Consider: d = b = 1. That is xt

I

Simplest example: Let yt

I (1) and zt = α0 xt

I ( 1 ) , xt

I (0)

I (1), and

yt = θxt + zt
with zt

I (0)

I

Hence, zt will rarely drift far from zero (if it has zero mean)
and will often cross the zero line

I

Equilibrium Relationship: yt θxt ; so that zt represent the
stationary deviation from the equilibrium

I

Therefore, yt and xt will not move too far away from each
other

yt = aWt + uyt
xt = Wt + uxt

where uyt and uxt are both I (0)
I

Then, yt

Testing for Cointegration
Engle and Granger proposal
I

Estimate the long run (static) relationship by OLS
yt = f (t) + βxt + zt ,

I

and compute the OLS residuals, ẑt
Then test for co-integration

those derived by Dickey and Fuller (ẑt incorporates the
OLS estimates!)

We have seen that ARDL models can be written in ECM

There is a very important result that connects the concept
of co-integration with the ECM representation

I

This result is known as the Granger Representation
Theorem

I

The theorem says (roughly) that a vector of I (1) time series
is co-integrated if and only if an error correction
representation exists.

I

This theorem is of great value both in theory and in
practice.
