Macroeconomic Theory I
Gregor Jarosch
195 JRR
email:gjarosch@princeton.edu

Overview: This is a graduate course in the first year macroeconomics field. I will teach the first half and
Esteban Rossi-Hansberg will teach the second half.
Organization: The class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9:00am to 10:30pm in JRR 198. A
preliminary syllabus is attached. The material may change throughout the course. There will be weekly
precepts at a time to be determined. The preceptor is Joseph Abadi. Finally, I will hold weekly office
hours.
Grading: Your grade for my part of the course will be based on five problem sets, counting for 30% of the
grade, and a midterm exam, counting for 70%. The grading for Esteban’s part of the course will most
likely use the same split.
Books: the following two books are recommended, i.e. they are good books to own. However, we will not
really use them so that you don’t need to buy them (Esteban will likely draw on SLP more than LS).
- Stokey, Nancy, Robert E. Lucas Jr. and Edward C. Prescott (1989), “Recursive Methods in
Economic Dynamics”
- Ljungqvist, Lars and Thomas J. Sargent (2004), “Recursive Macroeconomic Theory”.
Topics: The course will follow the designs of Richard Rogerson and Ben Moll who have taught the course
in previous years. Ben's slides for 503 are publicly available on his website. I plan, however, to teach on
the board and will certainly deviate from Ben's material frequently, in particular later on in the course.
The course will use the neoclassical growth framework to touch upon various key macro topics such as
growth, taxation, and the income distribution, but mostly it will serve as an environment to introduce
standard tools and methods used in modern macroeconomics. The following is a coarse and preliminary
outline of the course.
1. Some Basics
2. The Growth Model: Theory (most of the course)
2.1 The Growth Model in Discrete and Continuous Time
2.2 Transition Dynamics
2.3 Competitive Equilibrium
3. The Growth Model and the Data

Modern Economic Growth”

Neoclassical Model.” The American Economic Review, 83(4): 908–931

4. Policy Analysis in the Growth Model (Capital Taxation)

Lives,” Econometrica, 1986, 54 (3), pp. 607–622.
