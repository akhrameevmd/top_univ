Lecture:
Tu/Th 2:30-3:20 – McCosh 50
Organizer:
Jenny Shen (jenny.shen@princeton.edu)

Important Scheduling Note:
• Due to the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year), there
will be no lecture on Thursday September 21.
• I will give a “make-up” lecture Sunday September 17 at 7:30PM in McCosh
50.
Course Description: Economics is the study of how individuals, firms, and the institutions
of an economy (e.g., markets) produce and allocate scarce resources. We will examine 1) the
decision making of individuals regarding what and how much to consume, 2) the decision
making of firms regarding what and how much to produce, 3) how these decisions are coordinated (for better and for worse) through market and other institutions, and 4) the role of
public policy (e.g., taxation, expenditure, and regulation).
Classes: There are two lectures and one precept each week. Lectures start promptly at
2:30PM. Please be seated on time. All changes of precept must be arranged through the
organizer.
• Use of electronic devices is not permitted during lecture in order to help
us all focus on and partipate in the lectures.
• I will post lecture notes ahead of time. You are free to print these notes
and bring a paper copy with you to lecture.
Text: Parkin, Michael. Microeconomics, twelfth edition. Like virtually all texts today, it
is obscenely priced (an interesting economics issue in its own right). An earlier edition of
Parkin will easily suffice. Older editions of other texts may also serve well, although you
should check that it covers the relevant topics (not all do). Other reading assignments will
be made as needed during the term.
Note that the particular pages I assign in the text are a general guide. Other pages in the
“neighborhood” of the noted pages can be relevant, useful, and interesting. Take a look.
Some material is covered only in the text, some material is covered only in lecture, and other
material is covered in both.

Course Requirements and Grading:
Final Examination
Mid-Term Examination
Problem Sets & Participation in Precepts

45%
25%
30%

• The midterm examination will be held on Thursday of midterm week during the usual
lecture period. Be prepared to stay a bit longer than usual.
• The final examination will take place during the final examination period at end of
term.
• There will be 10 problem sets (one due each week other than the first week, the week of
Thanksgiving, and the week after fall break). The last problem set will be due during
reading period in January. A random subset (approximately half) of the problems
will
√ √ √
be graded on each problem set. The problem sets will be graded on a 0, −, , +
scale.
• Problem sets must be turned in at the beginning of your assigned precept during
the “due week” unless otherwise noted. Late problem sets or problem sets turned in
elsewhere will not be graded. No excuses.
Other Important Points:
• Use of personal electronics (including, but not limited to, laptops, hand-helds, phones,
and tablets) is not permitted in lecture. Use of such devices in lecture is a distraction,
and careful studies have shown that, on average, students do better on exams when
use of these devices is prohibited.
• We will be covering a lot of material, and you will do well to pay close attention and
not fall behind.
• In order to reduce your note-taking burden and to allow you to focus on the lecture, I
will post lecture notes on Blackboard.
• The posted lecture outline/notes will not include all material covered in lecture, and
you will be responsible for all material.
• New material will be covered in precept. You are responisble for this material as well.
• I do not closely follow the text. The text, lectures, and precepts are complementary
resources.
• You will get more out of this course if you discuss the lectures, readings, and ideas
with your classmates (and others). You are also encouraged to share ideas regarding
the problem sets, but you would do well to complete the problem sets on your own.
Of course, the work you turn in must be your own and prepared by you alone.
