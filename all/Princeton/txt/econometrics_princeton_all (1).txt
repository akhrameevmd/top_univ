version: September 20, 2017

i n s t ru c t o r ( pa r t i ) Michal Kolesár (mkolesar@princeton.edu)
Office: JRRB 278, OH: Wed 3–4pm
i n s t ru c t o r ( pa r t i i ) Bo Honoré (honore@princeton.edu), JRRB 392
ta Liyu Dou (ldou@princeton.edu), OH TBD Mon 4.10-5pm, JRRB A74
g r a d e r ( pa r t i i ) Charis Katsiardis (ck7@princeton.edu)
l e c t u r e s Mondays and Wednesdays 10.40am–12.10pm, JRRB 101
p r e c e p t s Time and date will be co-ordinated by Mr. Dou. Mon 3–4pm, McCosh 60
c o u r s e d e s c r i p t i o n Part I of the course provides an introduction to statistical theory. A brief review of probability will be given mainly as background material; it is
assumed to be known. Part II of the course provides an introduction to regression
analysis.
i n- c l a s s m i d t e r m Wednesday, Oct 25
f i na l To be scheduled
g r a d i n g Your grade will be an equally weighted average of grades in Part I and Part
II. Your grade in Part I will be based on weekly problem sets (30%) and an in-class
midterm (70%).

PART I: STATISTICS (SEPT 13–OCT 25)
t e x t Hogg, R. V., McKean, J. W. and Craig, A. T. (2013) Introduction to Mathematical
Statistics, Pearson Education, New York, 7th edn
The book covers all of the material of the course and, in addition, provides many
problems for practice as well as excellent references. Earlier editions are just as
good.
l e c t u r e n o t e s I will post lecture notes following each lecture.

p ro b l e m s e t s Only one problem (marked) is required from each problem set, the
solution to which will be posted after the due date. All other problems are for
your own study; the solutions to them won’t be posted, but will be discussed
during precepts. One problem from the problem sets will appear on the midterm
exam.
You are free and encouraged to work in small groups for the exercises, but you
should write up the solutions alone. If you worked with other people on the
problem set, please record their names in your write-up.
Problem sets should be handed in to the TA at the beginning of the Wednesday
lecture or sent to the TA via e-mail before the lecture. No late assignments will be
accepted.
