ECON 21100. Microeconometrics. 100 Units.
This course provides students with a basic understanding of how econometrics, economic theory, and
knowledge of institutions can be used to draw credible inferences on economic relationships. Topics
include multivariate linear regression, causal inference, omitted variables bias, fixed and random effects
models, simultaneous equation models, the propensity score, and discrete choice models. Students
have the opportunity to apply these techniques to empirical questions in industrial organization, as well
as in environmental, labor, and public economics.
Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: TBD
Prerequisite(s): ECON 21020 or ECON 21030
ECON 21110. Applied Microeconometrics. 100 Units.
This course will cover a broad set of applications in labor economics, public economics, industrial
organization, economics of education, environmental economics, and development economics. There
will be a strong focus on how economic theory, institutional details, and experiments can be used to
draw causal inferences on economic relationships. There will be emphasis on applying a number of
commonly used microeconometric methods to economic data; including the linear regression model,
fixed and random effects models, instrumental variables, and discrete choice models. When interpreting
the empirical results, we will also discuss the importance of omitted variables bias and measurement
error.
