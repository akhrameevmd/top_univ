Copies of previous Econ 199 examinations are available for purchase in SS101 and on-line via Chalk.
Grading:
The final course grade will be determined on the basis of performance on the four examinations. Each test
is weighted equally and independent. Students will be allowed to drop the lowest of the four scores. There
are no make-up exams; if a student misses a test then his/her grade will be based on the other three exams.
Students may not take an Incomplete. If a student withdraws from the course after Week 3 and is not
passing at that time, then he/she will receive a WF.
In addition, students are expected to have completed assigned readings before each session. Some
consideration in grading will be given for productive contributions to class discussions.
