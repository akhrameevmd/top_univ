BUSI2814.

Business ethics (6 credits)

Global business today has powerfully reinforced the importance of ethical behavior, especially for
managers and leaders. Now more than ever, the eyes of corporate stakeholders are on business leaders,
and ethical standards are being enforced. It is also important for companies to consider their duties to

6
society and a sustainable business environment. Diverging theories of Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) and methods for contributing to society, provide companies with a variety of options for their
social impact. Taken together, it is imperative for all current and future leaders to understand clearly
what business ethics and CSR entail, and have the tools to make proactive decisions when the need
arises.
The purpose of this course is to help you understand the role of ethics and CSR in business
administration in a complex, dynamic, and global environment. We will work together to develop the
tools necessary to face complex ethical situations, where action often must be taken quickly and under
considerable pressure. Business leaders cannot avoid making difficult ethical decisions, and any future
leader must be ready.
The goal of this course is not to explain the difference between right and wrong. In this course we will
provide a broad view of life in business, and practice identifying the ethical and social dimensions
embedded in everyday business decisions. Further, we will seek to gain clarity both on our own values,
and the psychological/environmental factors that influence ethical behavior.
The study of ethics is actually more of conversation about human interaction and interconnectedness
than it is an exact, quantitative science. In discussing ethics we will explore areas such as law,
accounting, finance, employment, corporate structure, and organizational behavior. This conversation
is necessary to shape and sometimes even counterbalance the more quantitative and amoral aspects of
business and economics education.

BUSI2815.

communication skills in this medium.

Students in this class are expected to be prepared for class discussions regarding readings, cases and
online discussions, and participate both in class and online as is suitable for a social media course. A
successful learning experience depends on contributions from both the instructor and the students.
Full and active participation is critical for achieving the optimal learning outcome.

BUSI2816.

Transformative business immersion in developing economies (6 credits)

This course is a five-week total immersion experience into unfamiliar geography, economy, sociality
and environment. After a one-week preparation period, students will travel to a pre-selected location
where they will immerse themselves in the daily economic lives of individuals in the community,
quickly working to pinpoint possible inefficiencies, weaknesses or stresses in the business processes,
relationships, and economic models in the small community. You will be living with local families in
a homestay arrangement, allowing you to more quickly understand the local culture, customs and
business practices.
During the course, the students’ task is twofold: first, students will immerse themselves in the daily
economic lives of individuals in the community, quickly working to pinpoint possible inefficiencies,
weaknesses or stresses in the business processes, relationships, and economic models in this small
community. Second, armed with knowledge gained in university and a vastly different perspective
from your new friends, you will work cooperatively with the local business and community leadership
to come up with innovative approaches to these issues.

7
This course is designed to be mutually beneficial to both the students and to the families and
community where they live, and with whom they share experiences during the length of the course.
Through all of this, students will gain experience in the practical application of business theory, will
forge new friendships with people they would never otherwise meet, will gain a greater appreciation
for the constraints and limitations in the development of rural places, and will hopefully make a
lasting difference in the lives of newfound friends.

Games and decisions (6 credits)

The first part of the course starts with sequential games and introduces the concept of subgame perfect
equilibrium for solving sequential games. Then it introduces Nash equilibria through a series of
concepts: dominant strategy, successive elimination of dominated strategies, and the minimax
approach for simultaneous games. It also discusses the limitations of Nash equilibria and offers
rationalizability as an alternative equilibrium concept. This forms the basic theory of the course,
which is used to analyze repeated games and collective-action games in the second part of the course.
Additionally, new solution (evolutionary stability) and equilibrium concepts (perfect Bayesian
equilibrium) are introduced to deal with applications that involve imperfect rationality or imperfect
information. Strategic moves and mechanism design are potential optional topics of the course.

Economics of networks (6 credits)

The world has become more and more connected since the appearance of the modern Internet in the

intermediaries. In a more connected world, buyers (sellers) can reach more sellers (buyers) and
intermediaries can reach more buyers and sellers at the same time. It is not clear whether such change
strengthens or weakens the bargaining power of the parties involved. Graph theory and (noncooperative and cooperative) game theory are introduced in this course to shed light on these issues.
Graph theory can also help us understand link analysis and Web search. Building on this, game theory
is used to provide an analysis of how sponsored search markets work. Other topics covered by the
course include: information cascades, network effects, power laws and rich-get-richer phenomena..

Natural language processing and text analytics in finance (6 credits)

This course covers the main elements of natural language processing (NLP), text analytics, and text
mining, providing students with a foundation in collecting, managing, and analyzing textual data with

social media to improve performance in asset/investment management, due diligence, Fed watching,
monitoring of company events, and detecting insider trading. Although students write their own
computer programs in this course, they are not required to implement most algorithms from scratch.
Instead, the focus of this course is on how to use existing state-of-the-art open-source software
libraries and how to apply them in a financial context. This course consists of three parts. In the first
part, we work with real-world textual data sets to obtain proficiency in collecting, importing,
organizing, and cleaning textual data from sources related to finance and economics. Among others,
we cover web scraping, textual corpora, text processing, tokenization, stemming, and stop word
removal. In the second part we delve into a more detailed analysis of NLP, text analytics, and machine
learning with a particular focus on FinTech. For instance, we examine bag-of-words, word weighting
schemes, document classification, document clustering, sentiment analysis, and topic models. The
third part consists of summarizing, displaying, and visualizing results obtained from NLP and text
analytics for applications in finance and economics.
