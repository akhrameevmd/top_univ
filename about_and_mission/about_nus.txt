Founded by the community for the community

History
We started out as a modest medical school with 23 students in 1905, founded by a determined group of businessmen led by Tan Jiak Kim, to serve the needs of the local community. Today, more than 100 years on, as Singapore’s flagship university, we continue to be in service of country and society. Learn more about our rich heritage and leaders of this institution.
