History & Tradition
Founded in 1817 as the “Catholepistemiad of Detroit,” the University of Michigan was the first public university in the Northwest Territories. Three Native American tribes, through the Treaty of Fort Meigs, ceded land to U-M that was sold to provide a significant part of Michigan's permanent endowment. Although the land was given "believing they may wish some of their children hereafter educated," the three donor tribes - Ojibwe (Chippewa), Odawa (Ottawa) and Bodewadimi (Potawatomi) - never received direct benefit. Generations later, in the 1990s, a group of students initiated a campaign to erect a memorial to the tribes that provided the land that helped fund the university's start.
