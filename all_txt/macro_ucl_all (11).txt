The supply side
Production function:

Links between the demand side and the
supply side:

y = af(k,n):
Assume capital and aggregate productivity
(a measure of the level of technology
among other things) only change slowly
so we can neglect them for the purposes of
analysing the business cycle.
Why? Otherwise the model would
become unmanageable…

Slide 1

This lecture: the labour market

Under perfect competition:

Under imperfect competition:

 Labour demand (LD)

 Wage setting (WS)

 Labour supply (LS)

 Price setting (PS)

 Potential output

 Equilibrium output

 Often referred to as the “classical”
model

 Sticky wages
 The Phillips Curve (PC)

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 3

Slide 2

The labour market under perfect competition
Labour demand

Labour supply

 Firms maximising profits

 Individuals maximising utility

 The real wage paid is the marginal
product of labour

 Tradeoff between disutility of work
and utility of income (consumption)

 so diminishing marginal product of
labour implies a downward sloping
LD curve

A rise in the real wage leads to:
 Income effect:
 Substitution effect:
 Assume the latter dominates so the LS
curve is upward sloping

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 3

Slide 3

The labour market under perfect competition
 Prices and wages and flexible so the
labour market always clears at “full”
employment and “potential”output
 Unemployment is voluntary
 This level of output is optimal
(microeconomic welfare theorems)
 What can policy do?

“Practical men [sic], who believe themselves to
be quite exempt from any intellectual influence,
are usually the slaves of some defunct
economist.” (Keynes, General Theory)

(Some of) the assumptions of perfect competition
1. No market power i.e. everyone is a price Do these hold in the labour market?
taker

2. Complete contracts

In the goods market?

3. Complete information

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 3

Slide 5

The supply side of the labour market when these assumptions
don’t hold
Incomplete contracts:
 firms can’t observe workers’ effort so
have to pay workers a real wage
higher than the reservation wage to
encourage them to exert effort
 the lower the unemployment rate, the
higher this wage must be since
workers will be less worried about
getting fired

Workers with market power:
 market power can either arise because
of unions or differentiated skills
 either of these will lead to workers
asking for a real wage higher than their
reservation wage
 unemployment is a measure of how
much bargaining power workers have
 when unemployment is low, workers
have more bargaining power so will
obtain a higher real wage

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 3

Slide 6

The wage setting curve
 although workers and firms care about
the real wage, in practice all wages are
set in nominal terms (this will be
important later when we talk about
sticky prices)

W = P(1 – au + z)
1. P
2. u
3. z

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 3

 the WS lies above the LS curve so
whatever happens in the goods market
there will be involuntary
unemployment
 the gap is a measure of the degree to
which the assumptions of perfect
competition fail to hold

Slide 7

Price setting
Under perfect competition:

Nominal marginal cost of labour:
MC = (1+t)W/λ

Under imperfect competition:

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 3

 where λ is the marginal product of
labour = afn(k,n)
 t are proportional taxes that the firm
pays
 for simplicity, assume λ is independent
of output
 then:

Properties:
Horizontal by assumption
Shifts if:
 the marginal product of labour
changes
 the markup changes
 firm taxes change
 anything else that takes a share of
the marginal product of labour
changes

Slide 9

Price setting, wage setting and aggregation
Wage setting:
 workers and firms agree on a nominal
wage specific to them Wf
 to get the aggregate nominal wage,
sum over all firms

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 3

Price setting:
 firms set the price of their own good Pf
 to get the aggregate price level
(corresponding to the CPI) sum over
all firms

Slide 10

The labour market under imperfect competition
WS / PS:

 it corresponds to the NAIRU (nonaccelerating inflation rate of
unemployment)
 there is both voluntary and involuntary
unemployment
 changes in the exogenous variables will
shift the WS or PS curves so change
equilibrium output

 if output is away from equilibrium there

Properties:

are no labour market forces which change
it

 equilibrium output is where price and
wage setting are consistent

A bit more on efficiency wages
Higher wages bring benefits to firms as
well as costs
Why?
 Better nutrition (developing countries,
UK in 19th century)
“highly paid labour is generally efficient
and therefore not dear labour; a fact which
 Fairness / morale – gift exchange
is more full of hope for the future of the
human race than any other that is known to
 Turnover
us” (Marshall)
 Adverse selection
 Moral hazard

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 3

Slide 13

Efficiency wages
Henry Ford and efficiency wages
In 1914 Ford offered workers $5 for an
8 hour shift. Wages had previously
been $2.34 for 9 hour shift, a 240% pay
increase.

Absenteeism

1913
370
1913
10%

1914 1915
54
16
1914
2.5%

Model this as a moral hazard problem:
• workers dislike effort and want to “shirk”
(i.e. turn up at work but exert no effort)
• firms cannot monitor effort perfectly
• firms pay a wage above the reservation wage
to encourage workers to exert effort
• if unemployment falls, workers are less
scared of getting caught shirking and fired,
so firms have to pay a higher wage
• the WS curve is upward sloping

Slide 14

Price and wage (“nominal”) stickiness
Sticky prices:
 some prices are flexible
 some prices are sticky

Sticky wages:
 most wages are governed by periodic
contracts, either formally with annual
union-bargaining rounds or informally

 a very rough estimate of the average
time between price changes is

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 3

Slide 15

Price and wage stickiness: in the model
In what follows we’ll assume
 wages are set for one period in
advance, and cannot be changed
during that period. “sticky wages”.
Then wage setting is:

 this implies the economy is always on

 and, except when output is at
equilibrium, workers will get a real
wage different from the one they
expected

 prices are flexible so firms can change
prices whenever they want

The Phillips curve and expected inflation
The PC can be written as:
π

   e    y  ye 
There are a family of PCs, with each one
corresponding to a particular level of
expected inflation.
Only at equilibrium output is actual
inflation equal to expected inflation.

Slide 18

The slope of the Phillips curve
If the period over which inflation is
calculated is the same as the period over
which wages are set, the PC is parallel to
the WS curve.

In the limiting case of flexible wages the
PC is:
and output is always at

If wages are set less frequently than
inflation is calculated, the PC is flatter
than the WS curve.
If prices were sticky as well as wages, the
PC would be flatter than with only wage
If wages are set more frequently, the PC is stickiness.
steeper than the WS.

Timing and expectations
Timing:
We’ll assume in each period events
happen in the following order:
 Expectations are updated

Expectations:
 For the moment, assume “adaptive
expectations”: expected inflation in the
next period is equal to current inflation

 Nominal wages are set
 Then, knowing this wage, firms set
their prices

 See lecture 5 for more detail

 Then the economy is on the PS curve
(and in general off the WS)

Is the economy unstable without policy?
Under perfect competition, any deviation
from potential output is reversed by price
or wage adjustment. Such mechanisms
which return the economy to equilibrium
without policy intervention are known as
“classical” mechanisms.
Potential such mechanisms in the WS/PS
model:

Simplistic view:
 Hayek: classical mechanisms are
powerful
 Keynes: no they’re not, “in the long
run were all dead”
However Keynes later came very close to
agreeing with Hayek that there are
powerful self-stabilising mechanisms…

 expected high real wages could lead to
entry into the labour force

… and a look at history says he was
probably right to do so e.g. over centuries,
unemployment rarely deviates much from
 expectations: if workers consistently get a its average for more than 5 – 10 years,
lower real wage than they expect, they will unless caused by poor policy e.g. UK in
change the way they form expectations
1920s; Eurozone…
