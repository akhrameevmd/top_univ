“The object of the science of Political Economy is to ascertain the laws
which regulate the production, distribution and consumption of wealth, or
the outward things obtained by labour, and needed or desired by man.”

Statement by the Council of the University of London,
explanatory of the nature and objects of the institution, 1827

“Political economy or economics is a study of mankind in the ordinary
business of life; it examines that part of individual and social action which
is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of the
material requisites of wellbeing.”

Alfred Marshall, Principles of Economics, 1890

Course Guidance
The main body of these lecture notes constitutes the examinable material for this
part of the course.
Threaded through that material are:
• Worked Examples: These demonstrate how to use the theory in simple
practical problems.
• Case Studies: These show examples of the theory informing applied empirical
investigation.
• History Notes: These provide historical context to the development of the
ideas.
None of these will be the subject of examination questions in themselves. Nonetheless
reading them should enhance your understanding of the course and the examination
will test ability to use the theory to solve problems and discuss applications.

Topic 1 : Budget constraints and consumer
demand
Summary: Consumer choice is restricted by affordability as captured
by the budget constraint and this alone restricts the nature of demand
functions. Dependence on the parameters of the budget constraint are
the basis for several ways to classify demands.

Budget constraint
Consumers purchase M goods q from within a budget set B of affordable
bundles. In the standard model, prices p are constant and total spending has
to remain within budget so that p0 q ≤ y where y is total budget. Maximum
affordable quantity of any commodity is y/pi and slope ∂qi /∂qj |B = −pj /pi is
constant and independent of total budget.
In practical applications budget constraints are frequently kinked or discontinuous as a consequence, for example, of taxation or non-linear pricing. If
the price of a good rises with the quantity purchased (say because of taxation
above a threshold) but without any discontinuity then the budget set is convex
whereas if it falls (say because of a bulk buying discount) or there is a jump (say
because a price change applies to units below the threshold) then the budget
set is not convex.

Marshallian demands
The consumer’s chosen quantities written as a function of y and p are the
Marshallian or uncompensated demands q = f (y, p)
Consider the effects of changes in y and p on demand for, say, the ith good:
• total budget y
– the path traced out by demands as y increases is called the income
expansion path whereas the graph of fi (y, p) as a function of y is
called the Engel curve
– we can summarise dependence in the total budget elasticity
i =

y ∂qi
∂ ln qi
=
qi ∂y
∂ ln y

– if demand for a good rises with total budget, i > 0, then we say it
is a normal good and if it falls, i < 0, we say it is an inferior good
– if budget share of a good, wi = pi qi /y, rises with total budget, i > 1,
then we say it is a luxury or income elastic and if it falls, i < 1, we
say it is a necessity or income inelastic

Case Study 1 : Budget constraints: Stamp Duty Land Tax

Residential property transactions in England are subject to a tax known as
stamp duty land tax. Prior to late 2014, if the value of the transaction was
below £125K the transaction was exempt but, once it exceeded that value, tax
was due at 1% on the whole of the value of the transaction. This meant that
as the value passed £125K not only did the after-tax price of owner-occupied
housing increase but also the tax that was liable jumped by £1.25K. At £250K
another threshold was passed at which the rate of tax increased to 3%, again
on the whole of the value so that there was a jump of £5K in the liability.
There were further discrete jumps for similar reasons at higher values. When
translated into a budget constraint between housing and other wealth this created
jumps (or “notches”) at these points and there is evidence that house sales
showed bunching at values just below these notches. Objections to the “badly
designed” form of the tax led to the announcement of reforms smoothing out
the schedule in the Autumn Statement of 2014.

if it falls with the price of another, ηij < 0, then we can say it is
an (uncompensated) complement. These are not the best definitions
of complementarity and substitutability however since they may not
be symmetric, in other words qi could be a substitute for qj while
qj is a complement for qj . A better definition, guaranteed to be
symmetric, is one based on the concept of compensated demands to
be introduced below.

Adding up
We know that demands must lie within the budget set:
p0 f (y, p) ≤ y.
If consumer spending exhausts the total budget then this holds as an equality,
p0 f (y, p) = y,
which is known as adding up.
If we differentiate with respect to y then we get a property known as Engel
aggregation

Case Study 2 : Engel Curves for Food

The extent to which nutrition responds to income in poor countries is an important issue for poverty reduction policy that is tied in with the nature of food
demand. The figure below shows the estimated elasticity of calorie intake to per
capita expenditure for households in rural Maharashtra, India in the mid 1980s.
The mean expenditure share for food is 0.73 in the poorest 10% of households
and 0.54 in the top 10% suggesting that food is a normal good and a necessity
in economic terms. Compatibly with this we see a total budget elasticity for
calorie intake between 0 and 1 across the range of expenditures observed with
some evidence of elasticity diminishing as total outlay increases.

Also certain specifications are ruled out for demand systems. It is not possible, for example, for all goods to have constant income elasticities
unless these

elasticities are all 1. Otherwise pi qi = Ai y αi , say, and 1 = i Ai y αi −1 for all
budgets y which is impossible unless all αi = 1. This does not rule out constant
elasticities for individual goods.

As a consequence, for example, if the price of some good goes up then purchases
of some good must be reduced so no good can be a Giffen good unless it has
strong complements.

Homogeneity
Multiplying y and p by the same factor does not affect the budget constraint
and, if it does not affect motivations for choice within budget sets, choices should
not be affected either.
Marshallian demands should therefore be homogeneous of degree zero:
f (λy, λp) = f (y, p)
for any λ > 0.

History Note I : Demand curves
The Marshallian demand curve is named after Alfred Marshall (18421924), a dominant figure in British economics in the late 19th and early
20th century. Marshall worked on the theory of demand in the 1890s
and was the first person to use the notion of elasticity. The first person to write down such an expression for demand was probably his Irish
contemporary Francis Ysidro Edgeworth (1845-1926).
Consumer demand is however a very old notion. The earliest empirical investigation of the relationship between quantity consumed and price
arguably goes back to the work of the seventeenth century political arithmetician Gregory King (1648-1712) on the price of corn. Mathematical
expression of a relationship between demand and own price can be found
in the work of the French engineers Augustin Cournot (1801-77) and
Jules Dupuit (1804-66) in the 1830s. The term Giffen good reflects observations attributed by Marshall to the Scottish statistician Robert Giffen
(1837-1910) on the demand for bread.
Engel curves are named after the German statistician Ernst Engel (18211896) who studied the relationship between the budget share of food and
both income and demographic characteristics in household surveys in the
1850s.
Definitions of complements and substitutes have a complex history that
cannot be untangled from ideas about utility discussed below. Early ideas
appear in the work of Stanley Jevons (1835-1882) in the 1870s, for example, but the most satisfactory conceptualisation came eventually from
the work of John Hicks (1904-89, Nobel 1972) and Roy Allen (1906-83)
at LSE in the 1950s.

Topic 2 : Revealed preference and negativity
Summary: Revealed preference restrictions can be seen as requirements
of consistency for choice across different budget sets. They impose further important restrictions on the nature of consumer demands including
justifying the Law of Demand.

Revealed preference
Suppose the consumer chooses q A at prices pA when q B was no more expensive than q A :
0
0
pA q A ≥ pA q B .
We say that q A is (directly) revealed preferred to q B . The Weak Axiom of
Revealed Preference (WARP) says that the consumer would never then choose
q B at any prices pB such that q A was affordable:
0

0

pB q A ≤ pB q B .
The Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference (SARP) says that there should
be no cycles in revealed preference so, for example, we should never find q A
revealed preferred to q B , q B revealed preferred to q C and q C revealed preferred
to q A (or any longer cycle).

Negativity
Suppose that as prices change from pA to pB the consumer is compensated
in the sense that their total budget is adjusted to maintain affordability of the
original bundle. This is known as Slutsky compensation. Then choices before and
0
0
after satisfy pB q A = pB q B . But the later choice cannot then have been cheaper
0
0
at the initial prices or the change would violate WARP. Hence pA q A ≤ pA q B .
By subtraction we get negativity:
(pB − pA )0 (q B − q A ) ≤ 0.
This shows a sense in which price changes and quantity changes must move, on
average, in opposite directions if the consumer is compensated.
If we consider the case where the price of only one good changes then we
see that this implies that Slutsky-compensated effects of own price rises must
be negative. In other words, Slutsky-compensated demand curves necessarily
slope down.
Note the weakness of the assumptions needed for this conclusion.

Case Study 3 : Revealed Preference Tests

Revealed preference ideas can be applied to data on consumer outcomes to test
compatibility of behaviour with economic models in ways that are not restrictively tied to any particular specification of preferences. Famulari, for example,
took data on over 4000 households in 25 metropolitan districts of the US between 1982 and 1985. She grouped them into 43 demographic types, to control
for taste heterogeneity, and looked for revealed preference violations in pairwise
comparisons involving consumption of nine categories of items. For the median
demographic type her results showed violations in only 0.70% of comparisons.
However, violations were much more likely in comparisons involving similar
total expenditure. When total expenditures were less than 20% apart the rate
of violation was 2.67% and when less than 5% this rose to 5.13%. Violations
of this sort could reflect inconsistent behaviour but could also arise from other
explanations such as taste change, issues of within-household decision-making,
problems of data aggregation or other inappropriateness of the model applied.
[Source: M. Famulari, 1995, A household-based, non-parametric test of demand theory, Review of Economics and
Statistics 77, 372-382. ]

Slutsky equation
The Slutsky-compensated demand function given initial bundle q A is defined
by
g(q A , p) = f (p0 q A , p)
- that is to say it is the demand if budget is constantly adjusted to keep initial
choice q A affordable. Differentiating establishes a relationship between Slutskycompensated and Marshallian price effects
∂fi
∂gi
∂fi
+
= qjA
.
∂pj
∂y
∂pj
The difference is the income effect qjA ∂fi /∂y and it is positive if the good is
normal. Hence, since the Slutsky-compensated effect has been shown to be
negative, so must be the Marshallian effect for normal goods. This is the Law
of Demand.
The Slutsky equation is highly useful. Its importance is that it allows testing
of restrictions regarding compensated demands since it shows how to calculate
compensated effects from the sort of uncompensated effects estimated in applied
demand analysis.

History Note II : Revealed preference, income and
substitution effects
The concept of revealed preference was introduced by the the influential
American economist Paul Samuelson (1915-2009, Nobel 1970) in 1938.
The weak axiom having been proposed by Samuelson, the Dutch-American
economist Hendrik Houthakker (1924-2008) introduced the strong axiom
in 1950 leading eventually to the tying together of theories of revealed
preference and theories of utility maximisation as considered below.
The separation of uncompensated price effects into income and substitution effects was established by the Russian economist and statistician,
Evgeny Slutsky (1880-1948) in 1915. Although politically radical in his
youth, Slutsky’s pathbreaking work in economics came to a halt in the
1930s Soviet Union as he chose to concentrate on less controversial fields
of statistics and meteorology.

Topic 3 : Consumer preferences
Summary: Specifying which bundles the consumer prefers to which others provides the foundation for a fuller modelling of choice. The nature
of these preferences can be restricted by assumptions which vary from
what is minimally necessary for a viable theory to assumptions which
seriously constrain the nature of choice.

Preferences
Suppose the consumer has a preference relation % where q A % q B means
q is at least as good as q B . For the purpose of modelling demand this can be
construed as an inclination to choose the bundle q A over the bundle q B . For
modelling welfare effects, the interpretation needs to be strengthened to include
a link to consumer wellbeing.
A weak preference relation suffices to define strict preference  and indifference ∼ if we let
A

• % and - be equivalent to ∼,
• % and  be equivalent to .
For any bundle q A we can define
• the weakly preferred set R(q A ) as all bundles q B such that q B % q A
• the weakly dispreferred set L(q A ) as all bundles q B such that q A % q B
• the indifferent set I(q A ) as all bundles q B such that q B ∼ q A (or, in other
words, as the intersection of R(q A ) and L(q A ))

Consumer Rationality
We want the preference relation to provide a basis to consistently identify a
set of most preferred elements in any possible budget set and for this we need
assumptions.
• Completeness Either q A % q B or q B % q A . This ensures that choice is
possible in any budget set.
• Transitivity q A % q B and q B % q C implies q A % q C . This ensures that
there are no cycles in preferences within any budget set.

Counterexample to Completeness :

Lecture Notes

Consumer preferences are incomplete if,

say, there are two goods q1 and q2 and q A % q B if and only if both q1A ≥ q1B and
q2A ≥ q2B . With these prefernces, the consumer simply cannot decide between
two bundles if each bundle has more of one of the two goods.
Counterexample to Transitivity :

Consumer preferences are intransitive if,

say, there are two goods q1 and q2 and q A % q B if and only if either q1A ≥ q1B
or q2A ≥ q2B . Take bundles q A and q C such that both q1A > q1C and q2A > q2C .
Clearly q A  q C . But if we take another bundle q B such that q1B < q1C but
q2B > q2A then q B % q A and q C % q B . Hence transitivity is violated.
To take another example, suppose there are three goods and preferences are
such that q A % q B if and only if the number of goods i for which qiA > qiB
is at least as many as the number of goods for which qiA < qiB . If we take
the bundles q A = (0, 1, 2), q B = (2, 0, 1) and q C = (1, 2, 0) then we see that
q A  q B  q C  q A which clearly violates transitivity.

Together these two assumptions are sometimes referred to as consumer rationality. They ensure that the preference relation is a preference ordering.
To make preferences mathematically well behaved we make the technical
assumption:
• Continuity If q A % q B and q B % q C then there is a bundle indifferent to
q B on any path joining q A to q C . This rules out discontinuous jumps in
preferences.

Counterexample to Continuity :

Continuity is violated by the example of

lexicographic preferences. Say that there are two goods q1 and q2 and that the
consumer prefers one bundle to another if and only if it either has more of q1
or the same amount of q1 and more of q2 . The consumer is indifferent between
no bundles that differ in any way and indifferent sets are single points. Given
any three different bundles it is easy to draw a path from the least to the most
preferred that does not pass through any bundle indifferent to the third, since
it is only necessary to avoid the path passing directly through the third bundle
itself.

Utility functions
A utility function u(q) is a representation of preferences such that qA % qB
if and only if u(qA ) ≥ u(qB ). A utility function exists if preferences give a
continuous ordering.

Lecture Notes

Utility functions are not however unique since if u(q) represents certain preferences then any increasing transformation φ(u(q)) also represents the same
preferences. We say that utility functions are ordinal.

Nonsatiation, monotonicity and convexity
A further assumption rules out consumers ever being fully satisfied:
• Nonsatiation Given any bundle there is always some direction in which
changing the bundle will make the consumer better off.
If this is true then indifferent sets have no thick regions to them and we can
visualise them as indifference curves.
The next assumption takes this further by specifying the direction of increasing preference:
• Monotonicity Larger bundles are preferred to smaller bundles.

Counterexample to Nonsatiation and monotonicity : Suppose preferences are
P
represented by utility function u(q) = −(q − γ)0 (q − γ) = − i (qi − γi )2 for
some bundle γ. Indifference curves for such preferences are circles around the
“bliss point” γ. Nonsatiation is violated since there is a bundle, γ, from which
there is no direction in which it is possible to increase consumer satisfaction.
Utility is increasing in all quantities provided that qi < γi for all i but not
otherwise.
Given monotonicity, indifference curves must slope down. This slope is
known as the marginal rate of substitution (MRS).
Monotonicity corresponds to increasingness of the utility function u(q). An
indifference curve is defined by u(q) being constant and therefore the MRS is
given by
dq2 
∂u/∂q1
MRS =
 =−
dq1 u
∂u/∂q2
which is obviously negative if ∂u/∂q1 , ∂u/∂q2 > 0.
• Convexity λq A + (1 − λ)q B % q B if q A % q B and 1 ≥ λ ≥ 0.
This says that weakly preferred sets are convex or, equivalently, MRS is
diminishing.
Convexity can be interpreted as capturing taste for variety. It says that a
consumer will always prefer to mix any two bundles between which they are
indifferent. The corresponding property of the utility function is known as
quasiconcavity.

Counterexample to Convexity : Suppose preferences are represented by utility
P
function u(q) = q 0 q = i qi2 . Preferences are monotonic but indifference curves
are quarter-circles centred on the origin and MRS is increasing rather than
diminishing.

Homotheticity and quasilinearity
Homotheticity and quasilinearity are both strong restrictions expressing different ways in which indifference curves within an indifference map can share a
common shape.
• Homotheticity If q A ∼ q B then λq A ∼ λq B for any λ > 0.
Graphically this means that higher indifference curves can be constructed
from lower ones by magnifying from the origin. This is a strong restriction that
would rarely be made in practice but it is useful to consider as a reference case.
It is not a restriction on the shape of any one indifference curve but on the
relationship between indifference curves within an indifference map.
If preferences are homothetic then marginal rates of substitution are constant
along rays through the origin. This is only true for homothetic preferences and
this is usually an easy way to check whether given preferences are homothetic.
If there exists a homogeneous utility representation u(q) where u(λq) =
λu(q) then preferences can be seen to be homothetic. Since increasing transformations preserve the properties of preferences, then any utility function which is
an increasing function of a homogeneous utility function also represents homothetic preferences. In fact all utility functions representing homothetic preferences
are of this form.

Quasilinearity is another strong restriction based on a similar idea. It says
that adding the same amount to one particular good preserves indifference. This
means that higher indifference curves are parallel translations of lower ones. In
this case, marginal rates of substitution are constant along lines parallel to axes.
If there exists a utility representation u(q) such that u(q1 , q2 , . . . ) = q1 +
F (q2 , q3 , . . . ), say, then preferences are quasilinear. This is also true of any
utility functions which are increasing transformations of functions with this
property.

Worked Example C : Preferences

Some examples of preference structures illustrate some of these properties:
P
• Perfect substitutes u(q) = i αi q1 : The MRS between the ith and jth
good is −αi /αj and is constant. In two dimensions, indifference curves
are parallel straight lines. Weakly preferred sets are therefore (weakly but
not strictly) convex. These are the only preferences which are homothetic
and quasilinear.
• Perfect complements u(q) = min[α1 q1 , α2 q2 , . . . , αM qM ]: In two dimensions, indifference curves are L-shaped with the kinks lying on a ray
through the origin of slope α1 /α2 . Weakly preferred sets are convex.
These preferences are homothetic but not quasilinear.
P
• Cobb-Douglas: u(q) = i αi ln qi : Preferences are homothetic, indifference curves are smooth and weakly preferred sets are convex. MRS is
−α
P i qj /αj qi . Typically, the expression for utility would be scaled so that
i αi = 1.
If there are two goods and we look along the indifference curve corre−α/(1−α)
sponding to utility υ then q2 = eυ/(1−α) q1
. So the MRS is
M RS = −

α υ/(1−α) −1/α
e
q1
1−α

which is diminishing in q1 .
P

History Note III : Utility
The relevance of “value in use” to demand behaviour is discussed in
many works of classical economics including those of Adam Smith (17231790), David Ricardo (1772-1823) and Jean-Baptiste Say (1767-1832).
The notion of quantifying utility appears as a solution to paradoxes of
choice under uncertainty in the mid-eighteenth century writings of Daniel
Bernoulli (1700-82).
Towards the end of that century, utility became the central principle in the
system of ethics developed by the British philosopher, Jeremy Bentham
(1748-1832) (whose dressed skeleton can be seen in UCL cloisters). The
link from Benthamite ideas and associated notions of consumer utility to
theories of demand is discussed in the notes on consumer choice below but
is particularly explicit, for example, in Stanley Jevons’ (1835-82) theory
of demand.
Indifference curves as a way of representing consumer preferences were
introduced by the Irish economist Francis Ysidro Edgeworth (1845-1926)
in the 1880s. To nineteenth century developers of these ideas, utility
was thought of as cardinal - measureable and comparable. The realisation that only the preference ordering matters to demand behaviour was
made by the American economist Irving Fisher (1867-1947) and Italian
social philosopher Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923) in the 1890s. The axiomatic approach to defining preferences originates in the work of the
Norwegian economist Ragnar Frisch (1895-1973, Nobel 1969) in 1926.
The conditions for existence of utility functions to represent preferences
were explored by the Norwegian econometrician Herman Wold (1908-92)
and French economist Gérard Debreu (1921-2004, Nobel 1983) in the
1940s and 1950s, Debreu for example introducing the problematic case of
lexicographic preferences.

History Note IV : Preferences
The Cobb-Douglas form for preferences is an especially simple form that
implies constant budget shares. It derives originally from the production function specified for work on the US by the American senator and
economist Paul Douglas (1892-1976) and mathematician Charles Cobb
(1875-1949). Preferences with perfect complements are sometimes referred to as Leontief preferences after their use by American economist
and Russian emigré Wassily Leontief (1906-99, Nobel 1973), pioneer of
input-output analysis. These are both examples of homothetic preferences, homotheticity being an idea used in the work of Ragnar Frisch
(1895-1973, Nobel 1969) but first defined formally in the work on production economics of Ronald Shephard (1912-82).

C Cobb

P Douglas

Stone-Geary preferences adapt the Cobb-Douglas form to give a simple
departure from homotheticity. As worked examples below show, this results in consumer demands identical to the linear expenditure system.
First suggested by the Irish economist Roy Geary (1896-1983), these preference were first applied to data by the British applied economist Richard
Stone (1913-91, Nobel 1984).

Topic 4 : Consumer choice
Summary: If the consumer consistently chooses the most preferred
among affordable bundles then it is possible to give a complete description of the properties that demands must satisfy. To see this, it is illuminating to think of consumers also as expenditure minimisers.

Consumer optimisation
Suppose that the consumer chooses q so as to best satisfy their preferences
within the budget set, which is to say to solve
max u(q)
q

p0 q ≤ y.

s.t.

Then choices satisfy WARP. In fact, the assumption of optimising behaviour
is equivalent to SARP. Utility maximising choices therefore satisfy negativity,
homogeneity and, assuming non-satiation, adding up.

Tangency condition
If all goods are chosen in positive quantities and preferences are convex then
the solution to the consumer’s optimisation problem is at a tangency between
an indifference curve and the boundary of the budget set.
This is true even for non-linear budget sets. However if the budget set is
linear (or indeed simply convex) then we know that such a tangency is unique
so finding one guarantees that we have found the best choice for the consumer.
If the budget set is not convex, on the other hand, then there can be multiple
tangencies and the optimum can typically be found only by comparing the level
of utility at each of them.
The nature of Marshallian demands can then be inferred by moving the
budget constraint to capture changes in y and p and tracing out movement of
the tangency.

Demand under homotheticity and quasilinearity
As income increases. slopes of budget constraints do not change. Income expenditure paths traced out by the tangencies as incomes are increased therefore
all occur at points with the same MRS.
Homotheticity and quasilinearity are each characterised by the nature of
paths along which MRS is constant and therefore each give rise to income expansion paths of particular shapes.
• Homotheticity MRS is constant along rays through the origin so income
expansion paths are rays through the origin. Quantities consumed are proportional to total budget y given prices and budget shares are independent
of y.

Lecture Notes

• Quasilinearity MRS is constant along lines parallel to one of the axes
so income expansion paths are parallel to one of the axes. Quantities
demanded of all but one of the goods are independent of y (so long as all
goods are chosen in positive quantities).

Constrained optimisation
Mathematically, Marshallian demands solve
max u(q)

p0 q ≤ y

s.t.

q

This can be solved by finding stationary points of the Lagrangean
u(q) − λ(p0 q − y).
For interior solutions, first order conditions require
∂u
= λpi
∂qi
which imply
MRS = −

∂u/∂qi
pi
=− .
∂u/∂qj

This is a confirmation of the tangency condition - the slope of indifference curve
and budget constraint are equal at interior solutions.

Expenditure minimisation
In comparison with the utility maximisation problem
max u(q)
q

p0 q ≤ y

s.t.

consider now the alternative problem of minimising the expenditure necessary
to reach a given utility
min p0 q

u(q) ≥ υ

s.t.

Solutions to this problem are Hicksian or compensated demands q = g(υ, p).
The problem can be solved by finding stationary points of the Lagrangean
p0 q − µ(u(q) − υ).
which, for interior solutions, gives first order conditions requiring
pi = µ

MRS = −

∂u/∂qi
pi
=− .
∂u/∂qj
pj

Note that this is exactly the same tangency condition encountered in solving
the utility maximisation problem.
We can define important functions giving the values of the two problems.
The value of the maximised utility function as a function of y and p can be found
by substituting the Marshallian demands back into the direct utility function
u(q). We call this the indirect utility function
v(y, p) = u(f (y, p)) = max u(q) s.t. p0 q ≤ y
q

The value of the minimised cost as a function of υ and p can be found by
costing the Hicksian demands. We call this the expenditure function or cost
function
c(υ, p) = p0 g(υ, p) = min p0 q s.t. u(q) ≥ υ.
q

The link between the two problems can be expressed by noting the equality
of the quantities solving the two problems
f (c(υ, p), p) = g(υ, p)

f (y, p) = g(v(y, p), p)

or noting that v(y, p) and c(υ, p) are inverses of each other in their first arguments
v(c(υ, p), p) = υ
c(v(y, p), p) = y.

Expenditure function
The expenditure function c(υ, p) has the properties that
• it is increasing in every price in p (assuming the good is consumed) and
in υ
• it is homogeneous of degree one in prices p, c(υ, λp) = λc(υ, p). The
Hicksian demands are homogeneous of degree zero so the total cost of
purchasing them must be homogeneous of degree one
c(υ, λp) = λp0 g(υ, λp) = λp0 g(υ, p) = λc(υ, p)
• it is concave in prices p, c(υ, λpA +(1−λ)pB ) ≥ λc(υ, pA )+(1−λ)c(υ, pB ).
This follows simply from the fact that the cost-minimising choices at prices
pA and pB no longer minimise costs at λpA + (1 − λ)pB .

Indirect utility function
The properties of the indirect utility function v(y, p) correspond exactly to
those of the expenditure function given that the two are inverses of each other.
In particular it is
c

22

Lecture Notes

• increasing in y and decreasing in each element of p
• homogeneous of degree zero in y and p:
v(λy, λp) = v(y, p)
This should be apparent also from the homogeneity properties of Marshallian demands.
(The property corresponding to concavity of the expenditure function is
known as quasiconvexity of the indirect utility function.)

Shephard’s Lemma
Among the most useful features of these functions are their simple links to
the associated demands. For example, it is possible to get from the expenditure
function to the Hicksian demands simply by differentiating.

using the first order condition for solving the cost minimisation problem and
the fact that utility is held constant in that problem.
This is known as Shephard’s Lemma. Its importance is that it allows compensated demands to be deduced simply from the expenditure function.

This is Roy’s identity and shows that uncompensated demands can be deduced simply from the indirect utility function by differentiation.
In many ways it is easier to derive a system of demands by beginning with
well specified indirect utility function v(y, p) or expenditure function c(υ, p) and
differentiating than by solving a consumer problem directly given a direct utility
function u(q).

Notice that this is the same as the Slutsky equation derived earlier for
Slutsky-compensated demands. Hicks-compensated price derivatives are the
same as Slutsky-compensated price derivatives since the two notions of compensation coincide at the margin.
This means the results derived earlier can simply be carried over. Hicksian
demands therefore also satisfy negativity at the margin. In particular
∂gi (υ, p)
≤ 0.
∂pi
Another way to look at this is to see that it follows directly from concavity
of the expenditure function and the fact, from Shephard’s Lemma, that compensated demands are derivatives of the expenditure function..
(Negativity can actually be stated slightly more strongly than this, involving
also restrictions on cross-price effects, but this is the most important implication).

Slutsky symmetry
There is one more property of Hicksian demands that can now be deduced.
From Shephard’s Lemma
∂gi (υ, p)
∂ 2 c(υ, p)
∂gj (υ, p)
=
=
∂pj
∂pi pj
∂pi
Compensated cross-price derivatives are therefore also symmetric. Holding
utility constant, the effect of increasing the price of one good on the quantity
chosen of another is numerically identical to the effect of increasing the price of
the other good on the quantity chosen of the first good.
This shows that notions of complementarity and substitutability are consistent between demand equations if using compensated demands and provides
a strong argument for defining complementarity and substitutability in such
terms. This would not be true if using uncompensated demands because income effects are not symmetric.

Integrability
To summarise, if demands are consistent with utility maximising behaviour
then they have the following properties

Lecture Notes

• Adding up: Demands must lie on the budget constraint and therefore
p0 f (y, p)

= y

p0 g(υ, p)

= c(υ, p)

• Homogeneity: Increasing all incomes and prices in proportion leaves the
budget constraint and therefore demands unaffected
fi (y, p)

=

fi (λy, λp)

gi (υ, p)

=

gi (υ, λp)

• Negativity of compensated own price effects: In particular, a compensated
increase in any good’s price can only reduce demand for that good
∂gi /∂pi = ∂fi /∂pi + fi ∂fi /∂y ≤ 0
• Symmetry of compensated cross price effects:
∂gi /∂pj = ∂gj /∂pi
If demands satisfy these restrictions then there is a utility function u(q)
which they maximise subject to the budget constraint. We say demands are
integrable. These are all the restrictions required by consumer optimisation.
We know a system of demands is integrable if any of the following hold
• They were derived as solutions to the utility maximisation or expenditure
minimisation problem given a well specified direct utility function
• They were derived by Shephard’s Lemma from a well specified cost function or they were derived by Roy’s Identity from a well specified indirect
utility function
• They satisfy adding up, homogeneity, symmetry and negativity.

Case Study 4 : Demand Systems

Banks, Blundell and Lewbel use UK data to estimate parameters of a particular
demand specification called the Quadratic Almost Ideal demand system. This is
an example of a general class of demand systems characterised by a quadratic
relationship between budget shares and the log of total expenditure, a functional
form that appears to fit data reasonably well. The estimates below are for a five
good system (food, fuel, clothing, alcohol, other goods) for nondurable spending
and are calculated for a relatively homogeneous sample of married couples in
the South East over the years 1970-1986, imposing homogeneity. Slutsky symmetry and negativity are tested and found to be statistically acceptable given
the estimated parameter values for all except a few high spending households.
Because the associated indirect utility function is known it is possible to calculate the exact welfare effects of reforms which change the prices of goods. The
authors of the study are therefore able to calculate estimated welfare losses,
measured in equivalent expenditure terms, for extension of Value Added Tax to
all forms of clothing for households in the sample as in the figure below. Note
that, rather than simply costing losses given existing expenditure patterns, such
estimated losses allow for behavioural responses.

History Note V : Consumer Choice
The first utility-based derivation of a demand curve is in the work in the
1840s of the French engineer Jules Dupuit (1804-66) on the valuation
of bridges where he identifies willingness to pay with marginal utility.
The Prussian economist Hermann Gossen (1810-1858) published work
in the 1850s which went almost unnoticed despite recognising the fundamental principle that optimal budgetary allocation would equate marginal
utilities of spending across goods. It was in the 1860s and 1870s that
the economists Stanley Jevons (1835-1882) working in England (and latterly Professor at UCL), Carl Menger (1840-1921) in Austria and Léon
Walras (1834-1910) in Switzerland all arrived independently at an understanding of marginalist principles. Jevons and Walras were enthusiastic advocates of mathematical formalisation whereas Menger was determinedly opposed.
Manipulation of indirect utility and expenditure functions is mainly a
twentieth century approach, though the Italian engineer Giovanni Antonelli (1858-1944) appears to have explored ideas more or less unnoticed
in the 1880s, including effectively defining an indirect utility function.
These notions reappeared in the 1930s and 1940s in the work of American economist Harold Hotelling (1895-1973) and French economist René
Roy (1894-1977) and mathematician Jean Ville (1910-1989). The expenditure function was introduced in the 1950s by American economist
Lionel McKenzie (1919-2010), the parallel between expenditure minimisation and cost minimisation in production economics allowing him to
pull across the lemma proved by Ronald Shephard (1912-82) establishing
the link to cost-minimising demands. These are designated as Hicksian
demands after John Hicks (1904-89, Nobel 1972) who was instrumental
in replacing Slutsky’s notion of compensation with that of holding utility
constant.

History Note VI : Integrability
G Antonelli

Negativity and symmetry as required properties of demands were proved
by Evgeny Slutsky (1880-1948) in 1915. The question of what properties
of demand are sufficient for compatibility with utility maximisation and
of how to work back from demands to preferences was first raised by Giovanni Antonelli (1858-1944) in the 1880s who recognised that the answer
would involve integration from implied marginal rates of substitution.
The conclusive solution to the question establishing adding up, homogeneity, negativity and symmetry as jointly sufficient conditions for integrability came in the 1960s work of the Polish-American economist Leonid Hurwicz (1917-2008, Nobel 2007), the Japanese economist Hirofumi Uzawa
(1928-2014) and American economist Marcel Richter (1932-2014).

Topic 5 : Consumer welfare
Summary: The view of consumers as choosing in their own best interests suggests natural ways to measure the effects of prices on consumer
welfare.

Consumer surplus
By Roy’s identity the effect of a small change in price pi on utility is proportional to the quantity consumed
∂v
∂v
= − qi .
∂pi
∂y
The horizontal distance of the demand curve from the vertical axis is therefore
an indicator of the marginal welfare cost of increasing price. If ∂v/∂y is constant
then the effect of increasing the price to the point where none of the good is
demanded is therefore a triangular area underneath a demand curve. We call
this consumer surplus.
What sort of demand curve do we need to use to keep ∂v/∂y constant? If
preferences are quasilinear then this will be true of the Hicksian or Marshallian
demand curve. Consumer surplus arguments are therefore rigorously justified if
preferences are quasilinear.
Even if preferences are not quasilinear the general idea behind calculating
consumer surplus as the area under a demand curve usually still gives a reasonable approximation to a good measure of welfare.
Along a compensated demand curve utility is held constant by construction
and qi = ∂c(υ, p)/∂pi . The increase in the cost of reaching that given utility as
a price changes can be regarded as a measure of the cost to the consumer and
can be equated to an area under a demand curve

If the fixed level of utility is initial utility then this is the compensating

Cost of living indices
The expenditure function is the ideal concept for comparing cost of living.
We can define a (true or Konüs) cost of living index as the ratio of the minimum
cost of reaching a given utility in two periods. Say that we are comparing

current prices pA with prices in a base period pB . Then the cost of living index
is the ratio of expenditure functions
T (υ, pA , pB ) =

c(υ, pA )
c(υ, pB )

Notice that such a cost of living index depends on the utility level υ at which
we make the comparison. Must this be so? There are only two case in which
not:
• If prices are proportional pA = λpB then the cost of living index is equal
to λ at all υ, whatever preferences,
• If preferences are homothetic then the cost of living index is equal at all
υ, whatever prices.
Two common approximations to the true index are used. Both compare the
cost of purchasing a fixed bundle of goods.
The Laspeyres index is the ratio of the costs of purchasing the base period

where the second expression shows that the Laspeyres index can be conveniently
written as a budget-share-weighted average of price ratios.
If L(pA , pB ) < 1 and consumer’s total expenditure is unchanged then the
consumer can afford the base bundle and cannot be worse off.
0
We also know that pB q B = c(υ B , pB ) where υ B is the base period utility
0
and also that pA q B cannot be less than the minimum cost of attaining uB in
the current period (since q B gives utility υ B but not necessary most cheaply
at current prices). Hence the Laspeyres index is greater than the true cost of
living index at base period utility,
L(pA , pB ) ≥ T (υ B , pA , pB ).
This is so because consumers are free to substitute away from goods which
become more expensive and therefore evaluating the cost at a fixed bundle
exaggerates the impact on cost of living.
The Paasche index is the ratio of the costs of purchasing the current period

By similar arguments the consumer must be worse off if P (pA , pB ) > 1 and

P (pA , pB ) ≤ T (υ A , pA , pB ).

Case Study 5 : Price Indices

If preferences are not homothetic and different goods change prices at different
rates then inflation will differ for households at different points in the income
distribution. The figure below shows rates of inflation for households in the
highest and lowest decile groups in the UK over a quarter of a century. These
are calculated from the UK Family Expenditure Survey using Laspeyres indices.
Inflation is not systematically higher for one group than the other but in individual years it can differ by as much as 5 per cent. It has been higher for the
rich more often but the biggest differences have been in years when the poor
were hardest hit.

History Note VII : Consumer welfare
Ideas for measurement of consumer welfare precede modern consumer
theory. Jules Dupuit (1804-66) introduced the notion of consumer surplus
in his 1840s work on bridges, mentioned above, and the idea was refined
by Alfred Marshall (1842-1924). Compensating variation as a measure of
the welfare effect of a price change was proposed by John Hicks (1904-89,
Nobel 1972) in the 1930s.
The notion of a price index as an average of relative prices for different
goods can be traced back at least to the English bishop William Fleetwood (1656-1723) writing in the early 1700s and as a ratio of costs of
representative bundles at least to the English economist John Lowe (d.
1831) in the 1820s. The Laspeyres and Paasche indices are attributable
to the ideas of fixing this bundle at either the initial or final bundle as
proposed by the German statisticians Etienne Laspeyres (1834-1913) and
Hermann Paasche (1851-1925) respectively. The suggestion that it would
be appropriate to take different bundles optimally delivering a fixed utility
and derivation of results about such an index’s properties is owed to the
Russian statistician Alexandr Konüs (1895-1990) writing in the 1920s.

Topic 6 : Endowments and labour supply
Summary: Extending the analysis to recognise the fact that consumers
may begin with endowments and buy as well as sell goods leads to a
richer model. In particular, it suggests a way to model supply of labour
and to understand why responses to wage changes may not be as simple
as responses to other prices.

Buying and selling
Suppose an individual has endowments ω = (ω1 , ω2 , ...) of goods. The
consumer problem becomes
max u(q)

s.t.

q

p0 q ≤ y + p0 ω

Demands are now
qi = fi (y + p0 ω, p)

i = 1, 2, . . .

where fi (.) is the standard uncompensated demand function. It is sometimes
convenient to draw a distinction between gross demands q and net demands or
excess demands z = q − ω. Let φ(y, p, ω) = f (y + p0 ω, p) − ω define a new
function giving net demands as a function of y, p and ω.
Changes in endowments have effects like income effects. Changes in prices
have the usual effects plus an effect due to the change in the value of the individual’s endowment - the endowment income effect. Specifically
∂φi
∂pj

=
=

∂fi
∂fi
ωj
+
∂pj
∂y
∂gi
∂fi
− (qj − ωj )
∂pj
∂y

where gi (υ, p) is the usual compensated demand function. This extends the
Slutsky equation to the case of demand with endowments. Note that, written
in terms of net demands, the equation is unchanged
∂φi
∂pj

=

∂gi
∂φi
− zj
.
∂pj
∂y

Notice that the sign of the income effect depends upon whether the individual
is a net buyer (qi > ωi ) as in the usual case or a net seller (qi < ωi ). An increase
in the price of a normal good can now increase demand if the individual is a net
seller and the endowment income effect is strong enough.
Note that there is an important revealed preference argument relating to
uncompensated demands in this situation. A seller will never become a buyer if
the price rises and a buyer will never become a seller if the price falls. In each
case, such a change is not possible since it would involve consuming a bundle
available before the change when the bundle then chosen remains affordable.

Labour supply
The prime example of the importance of considering demand with endowments is the analysis of labour supply. Suppose an individual has preferences
over hours not working (“leisure”) h and consumption c. They have unearned
income of m and endowment of time T. The price of consumption is p and the
nominal wage is w. The individual’s budget constraint is
pc + wh = m + wT ≡ M
which may appear more familiar if written in terms of hours worked l = T − h:
pc = m + wl.
The value of endowments in this context M = m + wT is referred to as full
income.
Suppose the individual is free to choose any hours of work, subject only to
their budget constraint. Demand for leisure can be written as an uncompensated
demand function, dependent on full income, wage and output price
h = φ(m, w, p, T ) + T = f (M, w, p)
or as a compensated demand function
h = g(υ, w, p).
The Slutsky equation for leisure is
∂f
∂f
∂g
∂f
∂φ
=
+T
=
− (h − T )
.
∂w
∂w
∂M
∂w
∂M
Since the individual sells time (h < T ) the income effect of a wage change
is opposed to the compensated effect if leisure is normal.
Rephrasing in the more familiar terms of labour supply l we can define an
uncompensated labour supply function
l = Lu (m, w, p) ≡ T − f (m + wT, w, p)
and an compensated labour supply function
l = Lc (υ, w, p) ≡ T − g(υ, w, p)
and it follows that

∂Lc
∂Lu
∂Lu
=
+l
.
∂w
∂w
∂m
The opposition of income and substitution effects is still there and the direction of the uncompensated wage effect on chosen hours of work depends upon the
balance between the two. Since that balance can differ at different wage rates it
is quite possible for a labour supply curve to slope upwards at some wages and
downwards at others as in a so-called backward-bending labour supply curve.

Worked Example I : Labour supply

Suppose the utility function defined over leisure h and consumption c has a
Cobb-Douglas form
u(c, h) = α ln h + (1 − α) ln c.
The budget constraint is wh + pc = wT + m which we can rewrite in terms of
labour supplied l = T − h to express the consumer’s problem as
max α ln(T − l) + (1 − α) ln
l

wl + m
p

.
The first order condition for solution α/(T − l) = (1 − α)w/(wl + m) is solved
by
l = (1 − α)T − αm/w.
Labour supply is increasing in w for all values of m > 0 so the substitution
effect always dominates the income effect for such preferences.

Case Study 6 : Labour Supply

Practical study of labour supply is complicated by a number of factors. Taxation
and benefit systems make actual budget constraints linking hours of work to
labour income much more complicated than the simple linear budget constraint
considered here. Corner solutions at zero hours may be optimal for certain
types of households with low wages and participation responses to changes in
budget constraints can be as important as adjustments in hours worked. Also
individual labour supply decisions of individuals within households need to be
modelled jointly to capture interdependence.
Lone mothers are a particularly common focus of policy interest. Over the
1980s and 1990s several changes in US tax policy were aimed at encouraging
them to work and these were accompanied by unprecedented increases in employment and hours. Meyer and Rosenbaum compare the behaviour of single
women with and without children to assess the contribution of different policy
changes using a large population survey. They find that over 60% of the change
was accounted for by responses to changes in tax credits, a smaller but still
significant proportion to changes in welfare programs and little to changes in
Medicaid, training and child care programs. They conclude that policies aimed
at “making work pay” rather than penalising not working are most effective in
achieving the desired effects.

History Note VIII : Labour supply
W S Jevons

Recognition that labour supply can be analysed as a consumer choice problem involving the weighing of disutility of labour against the utility of
consumption can be found in marginalist works, for example, of Stanley Jevons (1835-1882), Alfred Marshall (1842-1924) and even Hermann
Gossen (1810-1858).
The possibility that the opposition of income and substitution effects given
the endowment of time might create ambiguity in the slope of labour supply curves and even backward-bending behaviour was clarified by work of
British economists Lionel Robbins (1898-1984) and John Hicks (1904-89,
Nobel 1972) in the 1930s.

Topic 7 : Intertemporal choice
Summary: Allocation of spending over time can be seen as a further
example of the theory of demand with endowments. Particular features
of the intertemporal setting suggest restrictions on preferences which
put natural structure on intertemporal demand behaviour. If we allow a
variety of assets then in the simplest models their investment decision
is separable from the decision about when to consume the returns.

Intertemporal choice
Another example of demand with endowments is analysis of intertemporal
choice. Suppose an individual has preferences over consumption when young c0
and consumption when old c1 . They have endowed income of y0 and y1 in the
two periods. (If necessary, bequests received can be treated as part of y0 and
bequests given as part of c1 ). Assume no uncertainty about the future. If the
real interest rate on bonds linking the two periods is equal to r for both lending
and borrowing then the budget constraint is
c0 +

c1
y1
= y0 +
.
1+r
1+r

which implies that the present value of consumption must equal the present
value of income.
Demand for current consumption is


y1
c0 = f0 y0 +
,r
1+r
The effect of interest rate changes clearly depend upon whether the individual is a saver or a borrower since this determines the sign of the income effect.
Note that an interest rate rise will never induce a saver to become a borrower
and an interest rate fall will never induce a borrower to become a saver.
Often it is assumed that the utility function can be written as the sum of
utility contributions from the different periods with similar within-period utility
functions but with future utility discounted. Thus
u(c0 , c1 ) = ν(c0 ) +

ν(c1 )

where ν(.) is the within-period utility function and δ is a subjective discount rate.
Convexity of preferences, which amounts here to a desire to smooth consumption
over the life-cycle, requires ν(.) to be concave, ν 00 (.) < 0.

This is known as the consumption Euler equation. Given concavity of ν(.),
if r = δ, so that subjective discounting matches the market interest rate and
impatience cancels out the market incentive to save, then c0 = c1 and the
consumption stream is flat. If r > δ then c0 < c1 and if r < δ then c0 > c1 . In
all of these cases c0 and c1 will both be increasing functions of lifetime resources
y0 + y1 /(1 + r).
The responsiveness of consumption decisions to changes in the interest rate r
depends critically in such a context on the concavity in the within-period utility
function ν(.). The more concave is ν(.) the more sensitive is the intertemporal
marginal rate of substitution to differences in consumption between periods
and therefore the less dramatically do consumption decisions need to respond
to bring the MRS into harmony with the interest rate.

Asset choice
Suppose that as well as investing in bonds with fixed return of r the individual can also invest in another asset - say a family enterprise. If X is placed
in the family enterprise in the first period then suppose F (X) is returned in the
second period.
The optimisation problem now has two dimensions

and first order conditions (assuming an interior solution) are

ν 0 (c1 )
F 0 (X) =

1+r

(1 + r).

Note that the solution to the financial decision is independent of intertemporal
preferences. The individual invests in the family enterprise until the marginal
rate of return falls to the market interest rate. This maximises the present
value of the individual’s asset portfolio and the first order condition for optimum
consumption choice, given that present value, is as in the simpler problem above.
The simplicity of the investment decision is a consequence of assuming away
issues concerning risk, liquidity and so on.

Case Study 7 : Intertemporal Choice

The top two panels of the figure below show how mean consumption and income
vary over the life cycles of American households. The figure is made by taking
data from the US Consumer Expenditure Survey over the 1980s and early 1990s,
grouping observed households into generational cohorts according to their date
of birth and plotting the means of these variables against age. The humped
shape to both profiles reflects to some extent the pattern of household size as
captured in the profiles for numbers of adults and children below.
Regressing mean changes in log consumption on interest rates (with controls for
seasonality and demographic change) gives an estimate of the Euler equation
suggesting an intertemporal elasticity of substitution of 0.637 (with a standard
error of 0.333).

History Note IX : Intertemporal Choice
The application of marginalist ideas to questions of intertemporal allocation was taken up in depth in the 1870s by the Austrian civil servant
and economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk (1851-1914), a follower of Carl
Menger (1840-1921). His ideas led to development of the two period
model of income and consumption outlined here, laid out as a model of
intertemporal choice in the work of the American economist Irving Fisher
(1867-1947) in the early twentieth century and making clear the links between interest rates, intertemporal rates of substitution, intertemporal
rates of return and consumer time preference.

Relationships between paths of income and consumption were a prominent aspect of the life-cycle model of Franco Modigliani (1918-2003, Nobel 1985) and permanent income model of Milton Friedman (1912-2006,

Topic 8 : Choice under uncertainty
Summary: Choice under uncertainty can be modelled similarly in many
ways to intertemporal choice, with the distinction between states of the
world mirroring that between periods of time and aversion to risk mirroring the desire to smooth consumption over time. The theory is able to
describe important aspects of behaviour but also fails to capture certain
anomalies.

Uncertainty
Extending the standard analysis to the case of uncertainty involves regarding
quantities consumed in different uncertain states of the world as different goods.
Preferences will depend on perceived probabilities of states of the world occurring. Budget constraints depend on the mechanisms available for managing
risk.
Some examples of budget constraints in circumstances involving risk are:
• An individual with an asset worth A faces a probability π of losing it. He
can purchase insurance of K at a cost of γK. Consumption in case of loss
is c1 = (1 − γ)K and in the case of no loss is c0 = A − γK. The budget
γ
constraint for the individual is c0 = A − 1−γ
c1 .
• An individual with income of m has a true tax liability of T but tries
to evade an amount D by underdeclaration. There is probability π of
being audited in which case he pays the full liability T plus a fine f D.
Consumption in case of audit is c1 = m − T − f D and in the case of no
audit is c0 = m − T + D. The budget constraint for the individual is
c1 = (1 + f )(m − T ) − f c0 .
In both of these cases the budget constraint is linear, downward sloping and
independent of the probability π.
Preferences are defined over quantities consumed in the different states
(c0 , c1 ...) and depend on perceived probabilities of the states occurring (π0 , π1 , ...).
Under certain assumptions it may be reasonable to regard the consumer as maximising expected utility
X
u(c0 , c1 ..., π0 , π1 , ...) =
πi ν(ci )
for some state-specific utility function ν(.). We refer to u(·) as a von-NeumannMorgenstern expected utility function.
The most controversial assumption required to justify an expected utility formulation is the sure thing principle (or the closely related strong independence
axiom). Consider the following two choices:

In each case the two options deliver the same outcome as each other with
probability 1−π1 −π2 (though these outcomes differ between the two choices). It
might therefore be argued that the choice should be driven only by the different
outcomes occurring in the other columns. However these outcomes are the
same in the two choices. Therefore if A1 is preferred to B1 it is argued that
A2 should be preferred to B2 . This is the sure thing principle. Combined with
other less controversial axioms extending choice to uncertain situations with
multiple outcomes it implies that the MRS between consumption in any two
states is independent of outcomes in any other state.
Note that the function ν(.) is not ordinal. Preferences are changed by arbitrary increasing transformations of ν(.). However u(.) is still ordinal.

Risk aversion
To capture risk aversion we need to capture the fact that risk averse individuals prefer to receive the expected value of any gamble with certainty to
undertaking the gamble. Thus
ν((1 − π)c0 + πc1 ) > (1 − π)ν(c0 ) + πν(c1) .
For this always to be true requires that ν(.) be a concave function. The degree
of concavity is an indicator of the strength of aversion to risk.
Consider the insurance case again.
sumer chooses K to maximise

An expected utility maximising con-

(1 − π)ν(A − γK) + πν((1 − γ)K).
The first order condition requires
(1 − π)γν 0 (A − γK) = (1 − γ)πν 0 ((1 − γ)K).
If insurance is actuarially fair then π = γ and therefore ν 0 (A − γK) =
ν ((1 − γ)K). If the individual is risk averse then ν 0 (.) is a decreasing function
and therefore A = K so there is full insurance. This is a typical illustration of
behaviour under risk. The fairness of insurance means that risk can be eliminated without compromising expected consumption and a risk averse individual
chooses therefore to eliminate risk.

Case Study 8 : Choice under Uncertainty

Theoretical consumers behaving as expected utility maximisers seem to show
a perhaps unnaturally high proficiency in their understanding and ability to
work with probabilities. In practice there is abundant evidence that individuals
understand probabilities poorly. Even where probabilities are described clearly
their behaviour often fails to satisfy axioms upon which the theory is based.
They attach greater importance to the status quo than is explicable and their
decisions depend upon how the situation is framed when described to them.
A particularly well known example in which behaviour fails to fit is the so-called
Allais paradox. Consider the following two choices:



Kahneman and Tversky report the outcome of presenting these to 72 students.
In the first choice 82% chose A1 whereas in the second choice 83% chose B2 .
61% of students made the modal choice in both cases but this combination of
choices violates the sure thing principle. Presumably the attraction of certainty
in the first choice has something to do with this.
Expected utility theory captures some features of behaviour that we would want
to include, such as aversion to risk, and continues to be widely assumed in
much work but it has clear inadequacies in many contexts and exploration of
such deviations is an important part of ongoing research.

Worked Example K : Insurance

Suppose that an individual is an expected utility maximiser with within-state
utility function given by ν(c) = ln c. Since this is concave the individual is
risk-averse. Their objective actually has the form of Cobb-Douglas utility with
the probabilities taking the place of preference coefficients
u(c0 , c1 ) = (1 − π) ln c0 + π ln c1 .
The first order condition for optimal insurance choice
(1 − γ)π
(1 − π)γ
=
A − γK
(1 − γ)K
implies K = πA/γ. As expected this is less than A unless γ ≤ π. Wealth levels
in the two states are c0 = (1 − π)A and c1 = (1 − γ)πA/γ.

If insurance is less than fair π < γ then there is underinsurance. The extent
of underinsurance depends on the concavity of ν(.).

History Note X : Choice under Uncertainty
Development of ideas of probability in the eighteenth century was tied
closely to development of ideas about choice under uncertainty. The St
Petersburg paradox which seemed to suggest an implausible case in which
it would be rational to gamble unlimited sums of money was resolved
by the postulation of logarithmic utility by Daniel Bernoulli (1700-82),
alluded to in earlier sections.
The expected utility theorem was proved by the Hungarian-American polymath John von Neumann (1903-57) and German-American collaborator
Oskar Morgenstern (1902-77) in connection with their foundational work
on game theory. The sure thing principle was put forward by the American statistician Leonard Savage (1917-71) as part of a proposed axiomatisation of subjective decision theory. Measurement and comparison of
risk aversion in an expected utility framework was explored in the 1960s
by American economists Kenneth Arrow (1921-2017, Nobel 1972) and
John Pratt (b.1931).
The Allais paradox, attributed to French economist Maurice Allais (19112010, Nobel 1988), was one of several departures of behaviour from the
postulates of expected utility theory that have been apparent since the
1950s. Paradoxes such as these have done much to encourage the growth
of the field of behavioural economics associated, for example, with the
Israeli-American and Israeli psychologists, Daniel Kahneman (b. 1934,
Nobel 2002) and Amos Tversky (1937-96).

Topic 9 : General equilibrium
Summary: If we put consumers together and allow them to trade then
we can ask whether prices will exist that lead all markets to clear and,
if so, whether this provides a sensible or illuminating theory of price
determination. Adding profit-maximising producers to the picture turns
out not to complicate matters unmanageably.

Exchange equilibrium
Suppose the economy consists of H households. The hth household has
endowment ω h and consumes a bundle q h . An allocation of goods is said to be
feasible if the aggregate amount consumed of each good equals the aggregate
endowment
X
X
qih =
ωih i = 1, 2, ..., H
h

h

The initial endowments obviously constitute one feasible allocation.
Demands if prices are p are qih = fih (p0 ω h , p), i = 1, 2, ..., H where p0 ω h is
the value of the individual’s endowment. Note that there is no assumption that
different households have the same preferences. Market demand is found by
adding the demands across individuals
X
Qi (p0 ω 1 , p0 ω 2 , ..., p) =
fih (p0 ω h , p) i = 1, 2, ...
h

Note the dependence on the complete distribution of endowments.
Let zih denote the excess demand from the ith household. The aggregate
excess demand zi is given by the excess of market demand over the sum of
endowments
X
X
Zi (p) =
zih =
[fih (p0 ω h , p) − ωih ] i = 1, 2, ...
h

h

General equilibrium - referred to also as market equilibrium, competitive equilibrium or Walrasian equilibrium - is a set of prices such that aggregate excess
demand is zero on all markets.
X
Zi =
zih = 0 i = 1, 2, ...
h

A competitive allocation, if it exists, is another example of a feasible allocation.

Walras’ Law
If there are M goods then this seems to define M equations in M unknown
prices. However this is misleading. The fact that each household must be on
its budget constraint implies that the value of that household’s excess demand
is zero
X
X
X
pi qih =
pi ωih ⇒
pi zih = 0.
i

i

i

Adding this equation over households establishes that the value of aggregate
excess demand is also zero
X
pi Zi (p) = 0.
i

This is Walras’ law and is true for any prices (not only the equilibrium prices).
It implies that the M excess demands are not independent - in fact there are
only M − 1 independent excess demands to set to zero.
However since demands are homogeneous multiplying all prices by any positive number will give the same excess demands. If any prices constitute a Walrasian equilibrium, then so therefore do any positive multiple of those prices. It
is therefore only relative prices which are determined by the equilibrium conditions.
There are therefore actually M −1 independent equations determining M −1
relative prices.
A common diagrammatic representation of general equilibrium for a twoperson two-good exchange economy is the Edgeworth-Bowley box. This is a rectangular box whose horizontal and vertical dimensions are set to the economywide endowments of the two goods. Consumptions of the two individuals are
read from opposite corners of the box and any point in the box represents a
feasible allocation in the economy. Preferences of the two individuals can be
represented by drawing indifference curves. A price vector for the economy
defines a common budget constraint passing through the endowment point representing trading possibilities for the two individuals. Individuals’ desired trades
are defined by tangencies between this budget constraint and indifference curves
for the two individuals. Equilibrium exists if and only if these desired trades
coincide.

Existence, uniqueness and stability
Nothing said so far ensures existence of a Walrasian equilibrium but if aggregate demands vary continuously as a function of prices then it can be proved
that at least one equilibrium must exist.
There is no guarantee however that the equilibrium will be unique without
further assumptions on preferences and indeed economies with multiple equilibria are easily illustrated.
Whether or not prices in an economy out of equilibrium will tend to move so
as to take it towards equilibrium is a question that cannot be answered without

a theory of what happens out of equilibrium. If not all demands can be met
from the economy’s endowments then what happens and how do prices adjust?
It is possible to tell artificial and simple stories demonstrating the ability of a
hypothetical auctioneer to find equilibrium prices under appropriate assumptions about preferences but these arguably tell us little about the stability of
equilibrium in actual economies with trading taking place out of equilibrium.

Worked Example L : Exchange equilibrium

Demands if prices are p are qih = fih (Y h , p), i = 1, 2, ..., M where Y h = p0 ω h
is the value of the individual’s endowment. We need to find a price vector p
solving the market clearing equations
X
X
fih (p0 ω h , p) =
ωih i = 1, 2, ..., M
h

h

From Walras’ law we need only solve for M − 1 relative prices achieving market
clearing on M − 1 of the M markets.
As an example, suppose there are only two goods so we need to find only one
relative price to clear one market. Since we can solve only for the relative price
we normalise the price of good 2 to be 1 and let P be the price of the first. Let
there be two consumers A an B who have Cobb-Douglas demands over the two
goods. Individual h therefore has demands
q1h = αh Y h /P

q2h = (1 − αh )Y h

h = A, B

where αh is an individual-specific taste parameter.
Individual endowments are ω h = (ω1h , ω2h ). Therefore, by substituting the value
of the endowments, demands are
q1h = αh (P ω1h + ω2h )/P

q2h = (1 − αh )(P ω1h + ω2h )

To find equilibrium, we know from Walras’ law that we need only find the price
to clear one market. Take the first. Market clearing requires
ω1A + ω1B = q1B + q1B = αA (P ω1A + ω2A )/P + αB (P ω1B + ω2B )/P
Solving for P gives
P =

αA ω2A + αB ω2B
.
(1 − αA )ω1A + (1 − αB )ω1B

Note that this is increasing in endowments of the second good and decreasing
in endowments of the first. Note also that it is increasing in the demand
parameters αA and αB . These are readily intelligible demand and supply
effects for this example.

Equilibrium in economies with production
We can introduce production into the economy by assuming the existence
of K firms, each taking prices as given and choosing production plans so as to
maximise profits given their own technology
π k = max p0 y k
yk

F k (y k ) ≤ 0

s.t.

for k = 1, 2, ..., K. Note that firms are not being assumed to share a common
technology.
Inputs to production come from consumers’ net supply of endowments (and
particularly labour supply). Net outputs of firms supplement consumers’ endowments as sources of resources for consumption.
Firms are assumed to be owned by consumers so that profits are returned
to them. If the hth household owns a share θhk of the kth firm then its budget
constraint is therefore
X
p0 q h ≤ p0 ω h +
θhk π k
k

P
. All profits are assumed to be distributed in this way so that h θhk = 1 for
all k = 1, 2, . . . .
We can now redefine aggregate excess demand for any good as the excess of
aggregate consumption over endowments and production:
X
 X k
Zi (p) =
qih − ωih −
yi .
h

Given that

P

h θhk

k

= 1, note that Walras’ law still holds since
X
pi Zi (p) = 0.
i

Walrasian equilibrium is defined in the same way as a price vector which
ensures excess demands are zero on all markets. Existence of at least one
equilibrium is guaranteed if aggregate net demands are continuous functions
of prices, which in such an economy is assured by strict convexity of preferences
and production possibilities.

Limitations of general equilibrium analysis
Models of general equilibrium describe idealised economies without market
power for individual agents, without frictions which might prevent clearing of
markets and in which all interdependence between agents can be accommodated
through the price mechanism. They are interesting and important benchmarks
because of their interesting welfare properties, discussed below, but many of the
most interesting questions in economics are about the properties of economies
which do not fit such a simplified description.

where π k (p) and yik (p) are functions giving profits and net supplies given p.
From Walras’ law we still only need only solve for M −1 relative prices achieving
market clearing on M − 1 of the M markets.
To take a typically simple example, suppose there is one firm, one consumer,
one output and one input which is labour time. Suppose the only endowment
is one unit of time held by the consumer. The consumer receives all profits,
θ11 = 1.
We can solve only for the relative price so we normalise the price of output to
be 1 and let W be the price of labour (which is to say, the real wage). Full
income for the consumer is W +π(W ) where π(W ) is the firm’s profits returned
to the consumer as unearned income.
Let the consumer have Cobb-Douglas preferences so that their demand for time
is h = α(W + π(W ))/W where α is a preference parameter. Supply of labour
is therefore l = 1 − h = (1 − α) − απ(w)/W .
√
Let the firm have a technology which
√ allows it to produce output L with
labour input L. Profit is therefore L − W L. Maximising this gives labour
demand L = 1/4W 2 and maximised profit π(W ) = 1/4W . Equating supply of
labour to demand for labour requires
1/4W 2 = (1 − α) − α/4W 2
which implies equilibrium real wage

Case Study 9 : Computable General Equilibrium

One of the things to be learned from general equilibrium models is the way
in which changes in conditions in one market can ramify into effects on others. This can be particularly important, for example, in analysing the impact of
tax changes which affect goods which are inputs into production of many others.
General equilibrium effects therefore seem particularly important in considering
the effect of carbon taxes proposed as policy responses to global warming. Several institutions have developed computable multiple sector models to assist in
analysis. An example is G-Cubed, a nine-geographical-region twelve-industrialsector model of the world economy developed at the Brookings Institution. The
figure below shows projections for the impact of a gradually introduced fossil
fuel tax on the US economy (with revenue returned to households in the form
of lump sum rebates). by raising the price of coal, natural gas and oil, the
policy reform achievements significant abatement of carbon dioxide emissions.
Underlying this is a complex pattern of sectoral adjustments which feed through
into changing composition of GDP as illustrated in the lower panel. Scenarios in which the tax revenue is used differently can look quite different. The
virtue of this sort of modelling is that it can deliver a sophisticated picture of
the effects of nuanced reforms. The weakness is the sometimes opaque complex
dependence on details of the model’s formulation, estimation of its parameters
and assumptions about smoothness of equilibriation.

History Note XI : General equilibrium
Determination of prices in exchange is a topic that has been of longstanding interest to economics. Léon Walras (1834-1910) was particularly successful in formulating a mathematical description of a competitive equilibrium with multiple markets and with consumption and production of goods, inspired in part by notions of equilibrium in physics. The
Edgeworth-Bowley box used to illustrate equilibrium geometrically was a
construction introduced by the Irish economist Francis Ysidro Edgeworth
(1845-1926) and popularised by the English statistician Arthur Bowley
(1869-1918) (both sometime lecturers at UCL) after refinement by the
Italian social thinker Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923).
Rigorous proofs of theorems on existence and uniqueness of equilibrium
for an economy in which complete markets are hypothesised to cover all
uncertain contingencies were made in the work of the 1950s by the American economists Lionel McKenzie (1919-2010) and Kenneth Arrow (19212017, Nobel 1972) and his French coauthor Gérard Debreu (1921-2004,
Nobel 1983), work widely regarded as a highpoint of its brand of mathematical economics.

Topic 10 : Welfare theorems and public
goods
Summary: Competitive equilibrium exhausts the scope for mutual gains
from trade. Outcomes are efficient in the sense that it is impossible to
make everyone better off. Moreover any efficient allocation is supportable as a competitive equilibrium if government can redistribute endowments appropriately. If individual demands are interdependent, as there
are when there are public goods or externalities, then efficiency can be
promoted by public intervention.

Fundamental welfare theorems for exchange
equilibria
Walrasian equilibrium in exchange economies have the general property of
Pareto efficiency. This means that there is no feasible allocation such that all
consumers are better off (or some are better off without any being any worse
off).
To prove this suppose it were not the case. Then there would exist a feasible
allocation r1 , r2 ,... such that r1 was preferred to q 1 , r2 was preferred to q 2 and
so on. But then these bundles could not be affordable at the equilibrium prices
p or the consumers would have purchased them. Thus

But this conflicts with feasibility which requires h rih = h ωih , i = 1, 2, ..., M
Hence there can be no such alternative allocation.
This is the First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics. Walrasian
equilibrium is always Pareto efficient.
Note that this says nothing about desirability in other respects. There are
many Pareto efficient allocations and any Walrasian equilibrium that results
from particular initial endowments will be just one. The locus of Pareto efficient
allocations is known as the contract curve. Considerations such as distributional
equity may give good grounds for regarding certain allocations on the contract
curve to be socially preferred to others and whether or not these are attained
will inevitably depend, for example, upon the equity in the allocation of initial
endowments.

Lecture Notes

The Second Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics tells us conversely
that, under certain further assumptions, any Pareto efficient allocation can be
sustained as a Walrasian equilibrium given the right allocation of initial endowments. In particular, this is true if we assume all agents have convex preferences.

Efficiency of exchange equilibria
P
Take an economy with total endowments Ω = h ω h and consider choosing
the allocation across consumers to maximise the utility of one consumer, say
h = 1, subject to specified utilities, ūh , h = 2, 3, . . . , H, for all of the others:

∂uh /∂qih
=
∂ug /∂qjg
∂uh /∂qjh
for every pair of households {g, h} and every pair of goods {i, j}. Unless
marginal rates of substitution are equated across consumers then a reallocation
can improve some individuals utilities without harming others and the allocation is not Pareto optimal. Competitive equilibrium achieves Pareto efficiency
because consumer choice ensures all individuals equate their MRS to a common
price ratio.

Fundamental welfare theorems for equilibria
with production
Both fundamental theorems still hold for economies with production if assumptions are appropriately extended. In particular Walrasian equilibria are
still Pareto efficient.
To prove this, assume, as when proving efficiency in an exchange economy,
that it were not so. Then there would exist productions plans x1 , x2 ,... and a
feasible allocation r1 , r2 ,... such that r1 was preferred to q 1 , r2 was preferred to
q 2 and so on. But, as in the earlier proof, these bundles could not be affordable

Worked Example N : Contract Curve

Consider the two-person two-good Cobb-Douglas exchange economy described
earlier. Assume that both individuals have the same preferences, αA = αB = α.
Pareto efficiency requires that the two individuals have the same MRS

 A
 A

α
q2
q2
α
=
1 − α q1A
1 − α q1A
which means both consume the two goods in the same ratio. Plainly that
has to be the same as the ratio of economy-wide endowments Ω2 /Ω1 where
Ωi = ωiA + ωiB . The contract curve is therefore the diagonal of the EdgeworthBowley box defined by qiA = φΩi , qiB = (1 − φ)Ωi , i = 1, 2, for all values of
0 ≤ φ ≤ 1.
Every one of the allocations of the contract curve is sustainable as a competitive
equilibrium. Suppose, for example, that egalitarian principles mean that the
government favours the equal allocation qiA = qiB = 21 Ωi , i = 1, 2. If it intervenes to reallocate endowments to this point so that ωiA = ωiB = 21 Ωi , i = 1, 2
then individuals will not trade away from consumption of those endowments.

for every household h, every firm k and every pair of goods {i, j}. Marginal
rates of substitution need not only to be equated across consumers but also to
be equated to common marginal rates of transformation among firms. Competitive equilibrium still achieves this because firms face the same price ratios as
consumers.

Public goods
Public goods are goods that are usually characterised as nonrival and nonexcludable. Nonrivalry means that the benefits of consumption enjoyed by one
person do not compromise those enjoyed by another. Nonexcludability means
that noone can be prevented from enjoying the benefits once the good is provided. These characteristics are conceptually distinct and there are nonrivalrous
goods that are excludable (broadcasting) and rivalrous goods from the benefits
of which it is difficult to exclude people (common-pool resources like fisheries).
Provision of public goods raises problems both at the national level but also at
much smaller levels such as within individual households.
For simplicity, let us assume there is only a single private good, q h , and
extend the specification of utilities for individuals within the population h =
1, 2, . . . , H so as to include dependence not only on this good but also a collectively consumed public good Q, uh = uh (q h , Q). Let us also simplify production
technology so that there is a constant marginal rate of transformation between

Optimal provision requires not that the marginal rate of substitution between
the public and private good be equated for each consumer to P but rather that
the sum be equated to P . This is sometimes known as the Samuelson condition.
Provision of the public good benefits all consumers and these benefits need to be
totalled up when considering efficiency of provision not considered separately.

Private and public provision of public goods
How then should public goods be provided? Suppose that individuals start
with endowments of the private good from which they can contribute individually towards a common pool to be used for provision of the public good. Demands are now interdependent and we need to take that into account in deciding
how to model decision making. Suppose that individuals take the contributions
of others as given and consider the Nash equilibrium in private contributions
Gh . Each individual solves

equating individual MRS to P . It is clear that the condition for efficiency will
not be satisfied. The sum of MRS will typically be much greater than P . The
public good will therefore be underprovided as individuals fail to take account
of the benefits to others from private provision.
This is usually taken as a case for collective public provision, financed by
taxes and determined by some mechanism of collective choice. The appropriate
nature of taxes and the elicitation of individual valuations of public provision is
a topic pursued in courses on public economics.
It is the dependence of individual wellbeing on levels provided by others that
generates the inefficiency in private provision. Similar problems will arise from
other forms of interdependence. One person’s consumption of a good can affect
other’s enjoyment negatively (for example, noise pollution) and there can be
positive or negative interdependence between activities of different producers or
between consumers and producers. These are all examples of the more general
phenomenon of externalities.

Worked Example O : Public Goods

Consider an economy of N individuals consuming a public good Q and a private
good q h , h = 1, 2, . . . , N . All have preferences described by Cobb-Douglas
utility u(q h , Q) = α ln q h + (1 − α) ln Q. Individuals begin with endowments of
the private good ω h but there is technology through which endowments can be
transformed into the public good. The economy has a constant marginal rate of
transformation
P between the two

Pgoods such that its production possibilities
are h q h + P Q = Ω where Ω = h ω h .
Pareto optimal supply requires the sum of individual marginal rates of substitution equal the marginal rate of transformation

Substituting into the production possibility frontier gives P Q = αΩ.
If the public good is supplied privately then, assuming each individual contributes positively, each individual supplies only up to the point where

1−α Q
Each individual consumes the same quantity of the private good, q h = (1 −
α)P Q/α, and substitution of this into the production possibility frontier gives
P Q = αΩ/(α + N − αN ). The public good is inefficiently undersupplied.
If any individual has endowment below the common private consumption so
that ω h < (1 − α)Ω/(α + N − αN ) then they will not contribute. Equilibrium
provision will be determined by decisions among those who are contributors.

History Note XII : Welfare in General Equilibrium
The ethical defensibility of market outcomes has been a persistent matter
of political contention that has attracted the interest of economists for
centuries. The interpretation of the welfare theorems as vindicating the
observations of Adam Smith (1723-90) on the workings of an “invisible
hand” in market economies is common, if arguably strained.
The Pareto criterion for welfare comparison is owed to the Italian social
thinker Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923) and fits naturally with the withdrawal
from willingness to make interpersonal comparisons of utility associated
with his recognition that consumer theory relies only on ordinal description of preferences. Pareto himself understood that exchange equilibrium
exhausted the scope for Pareto improvements. Proof of the first and second fundamental welfare theorems are associated principally with work in
the 1930s and 1940s by Abba Lerner (1903-82) and Oskar Lange (190465), extended in the 1950s by Kenneth Arrow (1921-2017, Nobel 1972).
Lange and Lerner were both socialists by inclination concerned with the
possibility for decentralising efficient decision making under public ownership, Lerner a Russian-born economist who worked in the UK then the
US and Lange a Polish economist who worked also in the UK and US
before returning to communist Poland after the Second World War.

History Note XIII : Public Goods, Externalities and
Collective Action
Recognition that collective consumption creates a case for state intervention can be found in Adam Smith (1723-90). Conditions for optimum supply of a public good were proved in the 1950s by American
economist Paul Samuelson (1915-2009, Nobel 1970). The economic concept of externalities, the difficulties posed by them for market allocation
and the possibility of remedies through taxation were discussed by English
economist Arthur Cecil Pigou (1877-1959) in the 1920s. The possibility that well-defined property rights over externality-producing activities
would nonetheless permit the achievement of efficient solutions through
bargaining was discussed by the British economist Ronald Coase (19102013, Nobel 1991) in the 1960s. Elinor Ostrom (1933-2012, Nobel 2009)
has studied the practice of economic governance of common property resources.
