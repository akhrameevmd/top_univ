is very important that you work on your own before tutorial class. Tutorials will start on the third week. It will go through
some of the assignments.

2 short quizzes will be given during class on 3rd Oct 2017 and 21st Nov 2017 respectively to assess the understanding of
the lecture material. All quizzes are equally weighted. There will be no makeup quizzes.
