Censoring
The censored regression model focusses on a classical linear
regression model where outcome observations are censored. For a
certain range of values of the outcome, the econometrician does not
know the exact value but only that the variable is within a certain
interval.
Usually censoring occurs because of survey limitations such as top
coding, cost considerations or attrition.
Censored regression models are mathematically very similar to the
Tobit model. Whereas there were no observability issues there, here
data on the censoring region are “incomplete”.

Censoring

Adopting the notation in the Tobit model, the model is
y ∗ = β>x + u

u|x, c ∼ N (0, σ 2 )

y = min(c, y ∗ )
where now c is possibly random and instead of a max operator, we
focus on the min.
The max case is analogous and relates to censoring from below, i.e.
left-censoring, instead of from above, i.e. right-censoring.

Censoring
As in the Tobit case,
Pr (y = c|x) = Pr (y ∗ ≥ 0|x) = Pr (u ≥ c − β > x|x)
= 1 − Φ[(c − β > x)/σ]
And the density of y conditional on x = xi and c = ci is given by
(1/σ)φ[(y − β > xi )/σ], y < ci

1 − Φ[(ci − β > xi )/σ], y = ci

which is then used to construct a MLE much as in the Tobit case.
Censoring is typical in duration analysis (i.e., time-to-event).
Notice that in this case the marginal effects are given by β (as opposed
to Tobit)!

Censoring

For example, Costa and Kahn (2003) use data on soldiers in the
American Civil War to study how individual and community level
variables affected group loyalty as measured by time until desertion,
arrest or AWOL.
They use a more sophisticated statistical model (e.g., competing risks
hazard model), but we could also analyze the data using a regression
model where duration is censored.

Truncation

In a truncated regression model, certain observations are not selected
into the sample. This can arise, for instance, in surveys where for cost
considerations only a subset of the population is targeted.
The model relies on a regression model:
y = β > x + u,

E(u|x) = 0.

(1)

Using a random sample with n observations, we could simply use OLS
and obtain an unbiased estimator for β.

Truncation
Let’s assume instead that certain observations are fully observed
whereas others are not observed at all. Mark the selection into the
observed sample by the indicator variable si . This variable is = 1 if unit
i is observed and = 0 otherwise.
Instead of estimating equation (1), we instead focus on
si yi = β > si xi + si ui

(2)

When si = 1, we have (1) for the random draw i. Otherwise, when
si = 0, we obtain 0 = 0 + 0 which is vacuous and adds nothing to the
estimation. In the end, running OLS on (2) is equivalent to running
OLS only on those observations selected out of the n initial draws.

Truncation

When and how does truncation affect the estimation properties?
For consistency remember that we require that
E(su) = 0

E[(sxj )(su)] = E[sxj u] = 0.

These are implied by the stronger condition:
E(su|sx) = 0
which would also imply that OLS is unbiased.

Truncation
Now we can lay out a few scenarios:
I

If the selection rule s depends only on the explanatory variables x,
then sxj depends only on x and there is nothing in sx that is not
known beyond x.Consequently E(u|sx) = 0 since E(u|x) = 0 by
(1). Then, E(su|sx) = sE(u|sx) = 0 and the estimator is unbiased
and consistent.

I

If the selection is completly independent of (x, u), then
E(sxj u) = E(s)E(xj u) = 0 and OLS is consistent. It can also be
shown that OLS is unbiased.

Truncation
I

If the selection depends on the explanatory variables and
randomness that is independent of u, again one obtain
unbiasedness since E(u|x, s) = E(u|x). This follows because,
conditional on x, s is independent of u.

I

If the selection rule relies on the regressand y , OLS will typically
be inconsistent. For example, let s = 1 if y ≤ c where c is a
random variable and s = 0 otherwise. Then
s = 1 if and only if u ≤ c − β > x
Since s depends on u, they will not be uncorrelated even as we
condition on x. In this case, typically E(sxj u) 6= 0 and OLS will be
inconsistent.

Consider for example a linear regression model where:
y = β0 + β1 x + u
with β0 = 0 and β1 = 1.
Assuming distributions for x and u, we can simulate a sample for the
model above and examine the regression line obtained in the sample.

Take a sample with 30 observations:

The slope is close (though not quite equal) to β1 = 1. In fact,
β̂1 = 1.08.

Consider now only the observations where x ≤ 0.6:

The slope is (still!) close (though not quite equal) to β1 = 1. Here
β̂1 = 1.01.

Truncation
Consider now only the observations where y ≥ 0.5:

In this case, the slope is much flatter than before: β̂1 = 0.27!

Truncation

To address the last scenario, we expand the model to:
y = β > x + u,

u|x, c ∼ N (0, σ 2 ).

Remember that the selection rule is that a random draw (xi , yi ) is
observed only if yi ≤ ci .
(In contrast, in a censored model the realizations of xi would be known
for yi > ci .)

Truncation

The density of y given x = xi and c = ci is then given by
f (y |xi , β, σ)
F (ci |xi , β, σ)

if y < ci

where f (y |x, β, σ) is the normal density with mean β > x and variance σ 2
and F (y |xi , β, σ) is the corresponding cumulative distribution function.
This is then used to compute the MLE for the truncated regression.

Truncation
An important type of truncation in Economics is (what Wooldridge calls
“incidental truncation”), more commonly referred to simply as sample
selection.
We only observe y for a subset of the population and the selection rule
depends indirectly on the outcome.
The canonical example relates wages y = log(wage) to variables such
as experience. This variable is nevertheless only observed for those
who choose to participate in the labor force, a decision that may
depend on variables such as non-labor income.

The model here is
y

= β > x + u,

E(u|x, z) = 0

>

s = 1[γ z + ν ≥ 0]

(3)
(4)

where s = 1 if we observe y and zero otherwise. The variables x and z
are always observed. We will assume that x is a strict sub-vector of z
and z is independent of (u, ν).
Taking the expectation of (3) conditional on z and ν we have
E[y |z, ν] = β > x + E[u|z, ν] = β > x + E[u|ν]

Truncation
It follows that, if (u, ν) are jointly normal with mean zero, E[u|ν] = ρν
for some constant ρ. So,
E[y |z, ν] = β > x + ρν.
We do not observe ν, but know whether s = 1. Using the formula
above, it can be shown that
E[y |z, s = 1] = β > x + ρE[ν|s = 1] = β > x + ρλ(γ > z).
The last equality derives from normality of ν and (4) in a similar way as
in our analysis of censored regressions.

Truncation
The parameter ρ will be zero when u and ν are independent. In this
case, the selection is based on explanatory variables and a random
component that is independent of u. As we saw before, OLS on the
truncated sample will be consistent.
If ρ 6= 0, OLS will not be consistent: the inverse Mills’ ratio would be an
ommited variable. We cannot immediately include that variable though,
since it depends on γ, which is an unknown parameter. It can
nevertheless be estimated on the whole sample since
Pr (s = 1|z) = Φ(γ > z).

Truncation

Once γ is estimated we can plug in λ(γ̂ > zi ) as an additional explanatory variable for each observation in the truncated sample and run OLS.

This procedure, originally due to Heckman (1976), turns out to provide
a consistent estimator for β.

Truncation
Some caveats apply.
1. Standard errors need to be corrected to account for the first step
estimation of γ.
2. Strictly speaking we can have x = z as λ(·) is a nonlinear function.
Depending on the range of x though, λ(·) behaves very much like
a linear function and multicollinearity issues may arise. If there are
excluded variables appearing in the selection equation, this is less
of an issue.

Count Data
A count variable is a random variable that takes on non-negative
integer values: {0, 1, 2, . . . }.
One of the most commons distributions for such variables is the
Poisson distribution which postulates the probability mass function:
Pr (y ) =

exp(−λ)λy
,
y!

y ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . }

where λ > 0 characterizes the distribution and y ! = 1 × 2 × · · · × y . It
can be shown that
E(y ) = λ

de Paula (UCL)

var (y ) = λ.

ECON 2007: Quantitative Economics and Econometrics

27 / 34

Count Data
In modelling the dependence of a count variable y on x, the Poisson
regression simply assumes that λ is a function of x. Because λ > 0, it
is generally imposed that
λ = exp(β > x)
so that
Pr (y |x) =

exp(− exp(β > x)) exp(β > x)y
,
y!

y ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . }

(5)

and
E(y |x) = exp(β > x).

The conditional probability mass function (5) can be used to form the
log-likelihood to obtain a MLE:
L(β) =

n
X
i=1

n
X
li (β) =
{yi β > xi − exp(β > xi )}
i=1

where terms that do not depend on β are dropped without loss.
Noting that ∂E(y |x)/∂xj = exp(β > x)βj we can also form APE or PEA
estimators for the marginal effect of xj .

Some caveats:
1. The model imposes the restriction var (y |x) = E(y |x).
2. Even if this is not the case, the estimator for β is still consistent!
(In which case we refer to it as quasi-maximum likelihood
estimator.)
3. In this case, we can allow var (y |x) = σ 2P
E(y |x) where sigma is

consistently estimated by (n − k − 1)
i=1 ûi /ŷi where
ûi = yi − ŷi .
