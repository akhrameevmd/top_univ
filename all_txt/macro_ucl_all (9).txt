Can omit time subscripts when they’re all
the same e.g. y  c  v  g means

Models, theory and data
 The macroeconomy is exceedingly
complex both in cross-section and
time-series.

Dealing with this:
 Models are not the truth (“the map is
not the territory”); simply a way of
structuring our thoughts

 The models we can build are
extremely simple: “three equations” to
describe millions of agents interacting
 Distrust dogmatic statements about the
in endless complicated ways in an
macroeconomy, whomsoever they
institution and technological
may come from
environment that is constantly
"The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to
changing.
 The data we have is limited and noisy.
Structural change means historical
data is not necessarily useful.

 “ad hoc” e.g. c=c0+cyy ; c0, cy assumed constant
“The fundamental psychological law, upon which we are entitled
to depend with great confidence both a priori from our knowledge
of human nature and from the detailed facts of experience, is that
men [sic] are disposed, as a rule and on average, to increase their
consumption as their income increases, but not by as much as the
increase in their income” (Keynes)

Modelling consumption
Heterogeneity

The representative agent

Let ch,t be the consumption of household h Assume that the decision of a single
at time t
household can be used to represent the
aggregate behaviour of all households in
Then if there are N households in the
the economy i.e. ignore heterogeneity.
economy, aggregate consumption at time t
is
Is this a good assumption?

See CORE unit 12
In principle, each household could make
its consumption decision differently.

Slide 12

Modelling consumption: the permanent income hypothesis (PIH)
In words

Smoothing over the business cycle

 individuals optimally choose how
much to consume by allocating their
resources across their lifetimes
 resources include assets and current
and future income

Smoothing over the life cycle

 this is a forward looking decision and
will depend on interest rates, asset
values, expectations of future income,
expectations of future taxes…



the result is that optimal consumption
is smooth compared to income

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 1

Slide 13

The PIH: why is consumption smooth?
A simple example:

The property of the utility function which
means optimal consumption is smooth is

U = log c1 + log c2
c1+c2 = 10
What is optimal consumption?

Why?

Solving the problem gives an Euler
equation:

(to get to this we also need to assume ρ
= r)
i.e. consumption is smoothed (in
expectations).

How to solve this?
See derivations document on Moodle (you
would not be expected to reproduce this in the
exam)

Slide 17

The Euler equation: intuition
Imagine consumption wasn’t smooth (assume for this example that there is no
uncertainty)

but at what level? Substituting the

Individuals choose their consumption
to be the level at which they can keep
it constant over time, given what they
currently expect about their future
income.

Consumption is the annuity value of
expected lifetime wealth, “permanent
income”.

The permanent income hypothesis: implications
Consumption is not affected by
predictable changes in income.

What changes consumption?

The marginal propensity to consume
Temporary changes in income: if
current income yt increases
unexpectedly by one unit, consumption
increases by

Permanent changes in income: if
news arrives that current and all future
income increases by one unit,
consumption increases by:

The PIH: summary
(Some of) the assumptions
 representative agent
 infinite lifetime
 forward-looking behavior
 log utility

Implications


consumption smoothing



expectations of future income determine
consumption today



temporary changes in income have a small
impact on consumption



permanent changes in income have a 1:1
impact on consumption



Slide 21

Testing the PIH
News about an increase in income from y1 to Prediction: news about changes in
y2 at time t+1 is announced at time t
income should lead to an immediate
shift in consumption
 In the data, consumption is sluggish
Assume before the news arrives c=y1 (what
in responding to news
does this mean we’re assuming about a?)

Prediction: predictable changes in
income should have no effect on
current consumption
 In the data, consumption changes
by ~30% of the change
