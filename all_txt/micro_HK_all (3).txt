Course Description:
This course is an introduction to the fundamental principles and analytical tools of microeconomics.
The course will cover essential topics such as how markets work; markets and welfare; the economics of
the public sector; firm behavior and the organization of industry. One objective of the course is to teach
foundational concepts to prepare economics majors for subsequent courses in microeconomic theory.
However, majors and non-majors alike will learn how these basic concepts of economic analysis can be
usefully applied to real-world problems of current policy relevance.
Required Background:
There are no prerequisites for the course, although an understanding of basic mathematical reasoning
(including graphs and elementary algebra) will be presumed.

Microeconomics by the same author are also acceptable.
Course Requirements:
Students are expected to read the textbook chapters before class and to attend lectures. Requirements
include problem sets, a mid-term exam, and a final exam.
Course Grading:
20% 4 Problem Sets
30% Mid-term Exam (In class, Week 7, 17 October)
