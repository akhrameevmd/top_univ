Outline of the Course
Part 1: Origins of the 2007-13 economic crisis: why did a failure of the
…nancial system (of banks in particular) produce the largest recession
since the Great Depression of the 1930s?
I The …nancial system (banks) is the core of the economy. We cannot

understand macroecononmics if we do not understand how shocks
and policies a¤ect the economy through their e¤ects on the

Assume you wished to set up a company and to start you need 100K

$. You have 10K of your own (your

skin in the game) and borrow 90K from a bank. You then spend 95k to start the company (this is the
money working for you) and leave 5K in the bank as a bu¤er in case something (small) goes wrong

I

You can loose Your skin in the game. If you loose more, i.e. Other people’s money, you are bankrupt. Your
skin in the game is the bu¤er against possible losses: the smaller the bu¤er, the smaller the losses you can
withstand without going bankrupt.

Example: the balance sheet of a household
I Consider a household which bought a house …nanced by a mortgage
I How large is the mortgage as a fraction of the value of the house

obviously makes a big di¤erence
I Also the type of mortgage makes a di¤erence: is the interest rate

…xed, or does it ‡oat with market rates? At current interest rates
and at current house prices the household may look perfectly able to
make the mortgage payments, but what if house prices fall, or
interest rates rise?
I To understand how risky is the position of this household we need

to know its balance sheet, i.e. the value of the house and the size
and conditions of the mortgage.

I its leverage (the ratio of Assets to the family’s net worth) is

1060/160 = 6.625

I Assume house prices fall 30% and the value of the house falls to

700. The family is broke: it’s net worth has become negative:
60 + (100 300) = 140 (because the 100 of equity in the
house is less than the fall in the value of the house)

‡ows (monthly income and monthly mortgage payments) we would
not have guessed the family could be in trouble.
I The problem is that this family had too much debt. What would

have happened if its leverage had been 2 instead of 6.625?

I But what does "being broke" mean in practice?

I Assume the mortgage is a non-recourse loan, i.e. if the borrower is

delinquent the bank has only the right to re-possess the house. Now
the bank is broke (its equity,140 is not su¢ cient to absorb the loss,
200)

I

The balance sheet of banks is crucial to understand
I
I

I

remember that the reason banks hold equity is to absorb
possible losses on the assets they own

how much equity should a bank have is the central question in
the current debate about reforming the …nancial system and
thus avoid another …nancial disaster

their role in transferring savings from households to …rms
why they are fragile institutions

the more equity a bank holds, the larger its bu¤er, the stronger
the bank is, i.e. the less likely it goes bankrupt
the more equity a bank has, the lower its pro…tability: this
explains why raising equity is di¢ cult

Leverage
I

Assume a bank has an amount of debt (e.g. deposits) D and
an amount of equity (K̄ ) also called capital. Its liabilities are
L = D + K̄ , equal to its total assets

I

The bank holds two types of assets
I
I

14

loans and other investments (what we called Money working
for you )
reserves (what we called Savings for a rainy day )

I

Let α be the fraction of total assets invested, and (1
fraction kept as reserves

I

Investment is risky: for each dollar invested today you get p
dollars tomorrow; where p is a random variable. We may
assume E (p )  1 still with some probability p  1

Here we see why banks hold equity: in order to be able to
absorb losses (or gains) on their assets. Note that the capital

capital gain (p 1) (αL)— which is a capital loss for p  1

The last line says that the bank is broke when the value of assets is
not enough to pay for deposits
The possibility that the bank defaults (becomes unable to pay its
debt) introduces a non-linearity

Leverage and the probability that the bank defaults
What is the probability that a bank will go broke?
Prob (K̄

p1

K̄
αL

which is increasing in α : for a given value K̄ , the higher the
fraction of total assets the bank invests in the risky asset, the
higher the probability it goes broke.
How do banks choose α? They choose it so that the probability of
going broke is less than or equal to some number— say 5%
Prob p  1

K¯
αL

0.05

For given K̄ the above inequality determines the value of α.
17

Leverage and Value at Risk (VAR)

j (1 p ) αL j is also called the bank’s Value at Risk. K̄ should be
large enough to absorb a loss equal to j (1 p ) αL j which occurs
with a 5% probability

18

Leverage and VAR
The bank has two choices to make: α and K̄ . Using the expression
for the leverage ratio (λ = KL¯ ), the probability that a bank will go
broke is
Prob p  1
I

I

for given α, the probability that a bank will go broke is an
increasing function of the leverage ratio λ. To reduce λ the
bank can

keep its assets, L, constant but …nance them with less debt
and more equity (remember, L = K̄ + D)
keep K̄ constant but reduce L — for example reducing loans to

Banks may have a high λ and still be safe by keeping α low–and indeed
this was thought to be the case for European banks which own lots of
"safe" government bonds. This is why Deutsche Bank was considered
safe even with a value of λ almost three times that of Citi.

Leverage and the Crisis
I In the years before the crisis macroeconomic volatility was low, thus

Var (p ) was low
I low

Var (p ) meant that banks, for given α, could a¤ord a relatively
high λ— or, for given λ, they could a¤ord a higher α (they could
hold a higher share of risky assets)

I at the start of the crisis volatility suddenly increased and banks

responded by lowering both λ and α
I but this takes time because raising capital and reshu- ing the bank’s

assets takes time
I reducing
I
I

21

α is also dangerous because

if the bank reduces its lending to …rms (or stops lending to
…rms), investment will fall
if it sells other risky assets, such as shares, it pushes share
prices down precisely at a time when the stock market
(beacuse of the crisis) is already falling. This could generate a
negative leverage cycle

Leverage Cycles and Fire Sales

leverage = 10) is

I High leverage was not a problem so long as

α was low because
government bonds were considered safe. But when this assumption
no longer held, European banks found they had far too little capital

I This in turn made government debt more risk because the

26

assumption was that governments would bail out the banks if they
went bankrupt

The Financial System

I What is the …nancial system? What role does it play in the

economy?
I

The role of the …nancial system is to transfer the savings of
households to those who need the funds to …nance real
economic activity, e.g. set up a new company or expand an
existing one

I How can this be done? Start from the simplest case: the economy

of Robinson Crusoe

27

Robinson Crusoe’s Economy

I Robinson has a project: a land to farm. In his economy there is no

…nancial system, because Robinson has no one with whom to trade

Assets

Liabilities

Projects

Equity

Projects (farming) are wholly owned by the farmer (Robinson). In
this economy there is no borrowing, and no "delegation", thus no
need to monitor the managers who carry out the projects.

28

Financial System and Delegation
I Who owns the capital rarely is the best person to run a project

which uses that capital
I Modern economies work thanks to contracts that allow to delegate

the running of projects to more skilful individuals
I The …nancial system provides the institutional framework for those

contracts

Why do banks exist?

I Banks (and other …nancial …rms) exist because people in the

economy are di¤erent: they have di¤erent skills and di¤erent
needs— in economists’jargon they are heterogeneous
I Banks (and the …nancial system more generally) help solving the

problems posed by this heterogeneity

31

Two examples of heterogeneity - 1: Heterogeneity wrt skills
I Entrepreneurs are very special individuals. Their characteristic is to

have the skills necessary to turn ideas into projects and then run
them. They do this borrowing from people who do not have these
skills. Investors (those who own the capital) are happy to lend to
entrepreneurs because they hope to participate in the returns
produces by the e¢ cient exploitation of smart ideas
I The contract between a lender and an entrepreneur is complicated
I

I

entrepreneurs may not have the incentive to run their project
diligently enough. Once they have raised the funds from
investors they may prefer to spend time on the beach
lenders (investors) cannot observe how diligently the
entrepreneur is running her project, thus they can be fooled

I this "lack of trust" can be overcome if entrepreneurs risk enough of

their own in the project
I banks can facilitate the contract between entrepreneurs and lenders,
32

monitoring the entrepreneurs

Two examples of heterogeneity - 2: Heterogeneity wrt
liquidity needs
I Agents have di¤erent preferences
I
I

some wish to hold very liquid assets (demand deposits)
other need to borrow long term, e.g. a 30-year mortgage to
buy a house or to build a new plant.

I Another role banks can play is associated with the fact that they

can transform maturities, i.e. borrow by issuing demand deposits
and lend for 30 years
I We shall now study two models which describe some the

mechanisms underlying these two reasons why banks exist. In both,
as we shall see, balance sheets are central. (Of course our list of
reasons why banks exist is not exhaustive: there are a few more, like
the fact that banks may be better at evaluating the …rms’projects.)

1. Entrepreneurs, banks and small investors
2. The bene…ts and the risks of transforming maturities and providing
33

liquidity

1. Why do banks exist? Entrepreneurs, banks and small
investors
[Bengt Holmostrom and Jean Tirole, "Financial intermediation, loanable
funds and the real sector", Quarterly Journal of Economics, 1997]

There are 3 actors in the economy: entrepreneurs, small investors
and banks
Entrepreneurs
I

there are many of them; each one has
I
I

I

an idea implemented today will produce tomorrow
I
I

I
34

an idea that costs I dollars to implement
an amount A of cash they can dedicate to their idea, A  I

R  0 with prob p
0 with prob (1 p )

if they don’t invest their cash in their idea, entrepreneurs can
buy a safe government bond whose total return is 0  γI  R

The contract between entrepreneurs and small investors
Since A  I , the idea, to be implemented, needs outside funding.
Assume there are only small investors. They are small in the sense
that they do not have the resources to monitor how diligently the
entrepreneur whom they have …nanced runs her project
I

Entrepreneurs can a¤ect p, the probability of success, by
deciding how much e¤ort to put into running their project.
This creates a moral hazard if their e¤ort cannot be observed

I

If they put little e¤ort they enjoy a private bene…t B (e.g.
they spend more time on the beach, less on their project)
I
I

I

35

if private bene…ts are 0, p = pH
if private bene…ts are B, p = pL  pH

Small investors do not observe the entrepreneur’s e¤ort. Their
outside option (if they do not invest in the project) is buying
the safe government bond.

The contract between entrepreneurs and small investors

We assume that returns are such that investing in the
entrepreneur’s idea yields a higher return than investing in a safe
government bond only if the entrepreneur puts in enough
e¤ort:

36

I

pH R  γI

I

pL R + B  γI

How to make sure that entrepreneurs are diligent
To make sure that she works hard and thus achieves pH , small
investors need to o¤er the entrepreneur a contract that is
su¢ ciently attractive to induce her to work hard. Consider the
following contract:
I

if the project succeeds R will be divided between RE for the
entrepreneur and RS for the investors with RE such that the
entrepreneur has an incentive to put in pH

I

RE must satisfy
pH RE

pL RE + B

i.e.
RE
I

37

B/ (pH

pL ) = B/∆p

Note that, as pL ! pH , the contract becomes unfeasible
because giving the entrepreneur the necessary incentive
becomes impossible

Pledgeable income
I

Since RE
B/∆p for the entrepreneur to be credible when
he commits not to shirk, not all the income produced by the
project can be pledged to outside (small) investors
RS

38

(R

B/∆p )  R

I

Limited pledgeability arises because of the moral hazard
problem of entrepreneurs

I

Limited pledgeability is what makes contract theory (a lively
branch of economics) interesting. It is also what opens up an
intrusting role for …nancial intermediaries (banks) because
sometimes they can attenuate the moral hazard problem

To have an incentive to be diligent the entrepreneur must
contribute a minimum of her own to the project
I

Consider the small investor. If he does not …nance the project,
his alternative is to buy the safe bond with a return γ. Thus
he will only invest if
γ (I

pH RS
I

and since

(R

RS
I

A)

B/∆p )

small investors will lend as long as
_

A = A( γ )

I

39

I

[pH /γ (R

B/∆p )]

i.e. unless_the entrepreneur contributes a minimum amount of
her own, A(γ), she cannot credibly commit to pH
which will be the return for small investors when they invest in
the project? Competition among them will bring it down to γ,
the return on their alternative option, which is investing in
safe bonds

How can banks help
Banks can …nance the entrepreneur’s project. But di¤erently from
small investors they can also monitor how diligently she runs it.
They cannot control the entrepreneur perfectly (i.e. make sure
B = 0) but, by spending some money, they can avoid "extreme"
negligence, i.e. they can reduce the entrepreneur’s outside bene…t
to b  B. When the entrepreneur enjoys b the prob of success
remains pL . The bank’s monitoring cost is c  0.
I
I

if the project succeeds, R will be shared: R = RE + RS + RB
the entrepreneur must be guaranteed

I

where the only di¤erence is that now b  B
the bank must be guaranteed a total gross return RB large

The minimum amount the bank must contribute to be
credible when it says it will monitor the entrepreneur
I Let IB be the amount the bank contributes to the project. How

large should IB be?
I To determine this value we need to start from the bank’s outside

option: call β the return the bank can obtain if it invests elsewhere
in the economy. The bank must therefore be guaranteed a total net
return (that is net of the monitoring cost) at least equal to βIB ,
where

βIB = pH RB
using RB

c = c (pH /∆p

c/∆p
IB =

β∆p

I For any given value of the bank’s outside option,

β, this value of IB
is the minimum amount the bank must contribute to be credible
when it says it will monitor the entrepreneur

41

The amount the bank will be asked to contribute
I Because monitoring is costly, the entrepreneur will …nance through

the bank as little of the project as possible, that is no more than
cp L
∆p . The reason is that in order to o¤er the bank a net return
equal to β, the entrepreneur must pay a gross return larger than β,
that is large enough to cover monitoring costs

IB =

I

assume for instance, that the bank’s outside option— its return
if it invests elsewhere in the economy— is γ, equal to the
outside option of small investors. Then the gross return the
entrepreneur must pay the bank per unit it invests in the
project is γ + c/IB  γ. Even in this case the entrepreneur
will not fund more than IB from the bank

I Finally note that a bank that has no capital— and thus can

contribute nothing of its own to the project— and simply …nances all
its loans to …rms issuing deposits is useless — at least if we think
that the main reason why banks exist is to monitor …rms
42

What is there for small investors?
I

When RE and RB are such that the entrepreneur has an
incentive to be diligent, and the bank has an incentive to
monitor, small investors get
RS = [R

(b + c ) /∆p ]

and must contribute I A IB . Since their alternative
remains the safe bond, they will …nance the project provided
γ [I

This condition can be re-written as

What can go wrong? (1)

A could fall (e.g. asset price shock from a bubble bursting)
Assume the entrepreneur contributes the real estate, for instance
the land where the project
is developed. If real estate prices fall, A
_
will fall. If it falls below A(γ), projects that previously could be
…nanced only by small investors, now need a bank because the
value of what the entrepreneur contributes is no longer su¢ cient to
attract small investors.

What can go wrong? (2)

c is too small (e.g. subprimes)
c pH
Remember that IB

monitoring, c, is small (or underestimates the cost of monitoring)
it will contribute too little to the project. Ex-post it will have no
incentive to do the monitoring. In this case the entrepreneur’s

RE =

∆p

What can go wrong ? (3)

The bank may not have enough capital to credibly commit to
monitor entrepreneurs. Remember that the minimum amount a
bank must contribute to the project is IB ( β) = cβ∆ppH . If it commits
less then IB ( β) its return is insu¢ cient to cover the cost of
monitoring, thus the bank will not monitor.

47

What happened before and during the crisis ?
Each one of the three things that could go wrong has gone wrong:

1. c : before the crisis banks had reduced their direct investments in
the projects they had …nanced. They had done this selling their
loans to other investors (what is called securitization, assembling a
large number of mortgages and building a …nancial security which
contains them all.) The bene…t was less exposure to risk; the cost
was reduced incentive to monitor.

2. IB ( β): banks’capital fell during the crisis. This means that banks
had less capital for direct lending.

3. A: the fall in real estate prices and in asset prices in general,
reduced the value of A, the resources entrepreneurs could commit
to their projects.

48

2. Why do banks exist? Second example: heterogeneity
wrt preferences
I The second role banks play is associated with the fact that they can

"transform maturities", i.e. borrow short (by issuing checking
accounts) and lend long (e.g. for 30 years).
I This is useful because some agents in the economy wish to hold

very liquid assets (checking accounts), while other agents need to
borrow long term, e.g. a 30-year mortgage to buy a house or to
build a new plant, In other words people di¤er in their preferences
as to when they want to consume.
I Without a bank it would be hard to …nd a mortgage. Assume all

households wished to keep their savings in checking accounts: then
who would buy a 30-year mortgage?

A model of maturity transformation
[Diamond, D., and P. Dybvig "Bank runs, deposit insurance and
liquidity", Journal of Political Economy, 1983]
There are 3 periods
I

t = 0 agents start with 1 unit of endowment each. Investment
decisions are made. 2 technologies are available:
I
I

I

50

one delivers 1 unit of output in t = 1 for each unit of output
invested in t = 0
the other delivers R  1 units of output in t = 2 for each unit
of output invested in t = 0. However, if this technology is
liquidated in t = 1 it delivers L  1 units of output

t = 1 and t = 2: agents consume

Agents’types

I

There are 2 types of agents, and many agents of each type. The
size of the population is normalized to 1.
I
I
I

"patient", who consume only in t = 2 and nothing in t = 1
"impatient" who consume all in t = 1
agents learn their type only in t = 1 all they know in t = 0 is
prob (being patient ) = π
prob (being impatient ) = 1 π

I of course if you knew your type in

t = 0 you could invest
everything in one technology or the other.

51

The world of Robinson Crusoe: no banks and no one with
whom to trade

Call I the amount agents invest in the technology with return R at
t = 0. Then their consumption options are

R (= R only

Market economy
In t = 1 agents can trade.
I An agent who …nds out he is impatient can issue a bond that

promises to pay 1 unit of good in t = 2, sell it and eat in t = 1.
The price of this bond is p. p is a relative price that transforms
t = 2 goods in t = 1 goods

p=

[units of t = 1 goods ]
[units of t = 2 goods ]

I Since the impatient agent will receive

RI in t = 2, he can trade it

for p (RI ) units of t = 1 goods
I Similarly an agent who …nds out he is patient will trade

units of t = 1 goods,which he does not need, for (1
of t = 2 goods
I Thus
I

I

I )/p units

c1M = (1 I ) + pRI if impatient, where the superscipt M
refers to the market equilibrium
(1 I )
c2M = p + RI
if patient

Market economy (cont.)

I If

1/p  R, agents choose I = 0 because by trading at price p
they can do better than investing at return R. Remember
1/p =

[units of t = 2 goods ]
[units of t = 1 goods ]

Thus

c1M = 1,
I If

1/p  R, agents choose I = 1 and
c1M = pR,

54

c2M = 1/p.

c2M = R

Market economy (cont.)

Neither p  1/R , nor p  1/R are feasible because they imply that
c1M , c2M exceed the resources available to the economy
I

p  1/R =) I = 1, c2M = R and c1M = pR  1: this is
unfeasible

I

p  1/R =) I = 0, c1M = 1 and c2M = 1/p  R : this is also
unfeasible

55

Market economy (cont.)
The only feasible equilibrium is p = 1/R where agents choose
I

c1M = 1 if impatient

I

c2M = R if patient

I

I M 2 [0, 1]

The last task is …nding I M , the amount invested in the "long"
technology. In order for these choices to be feasible I M must be such that

So I M must be equal to π.

56

IM

Why the market outcome is (in general) not optimal
The market equilibrium is:
I
I

c1M = 1 if impatient
c2M = R if patient

i.e. agents who …nd out they are impatient forgo R and consume 1  R.
I the market economy yields the same allocation agents would have

chosen had they known their type in t = 0.
I i.e. it eliminates the ine¢ ciency caused by uncertainty (the Autarkic
I

equilibrium is ine¢ cient: there is always some liquidation).
c1M = 1, c M
2 = R may not be the best solution. If in t = 0
agents could insure against the possibility that in t = 1 they …nd
ou
n t they are impatient, they might
o wish to consume

c1  c1M = 1, c 2  c2M = R

consumption levels. How could they insure? 2
are assuming that agents give identical importance to
consumption in the two periods, i.e. there is no discounting. In other
words agents maximize U = (1 π ) u (c1I ) + πu (c2P ). They will wish to
insure provided (1 π ) u 0 (1)  πu 0 (R ) where u 0 is the marginal utility of
consumption.

How can a bank improve upon the market outcome
I Assume we want to achieve
I in

fc1  1, c 2  R, c1  c 2 g

t = 0 the bank issues demand deposits: in exchange for a
deposit of one unit at t = 0, agents receive either c1 at t = 1, or
c2 at t = 2. To achieve this the bank, in t = 0 stores (1 π ) c1
and invests πc2 /R in the technology which yields R in t = 2 (of
course subject to the constraint (1 π ) c1 +πc2 /R = 1)

I the bank achieves the optimal allocation provided no individual

withdraws at t = 1 unless she does not have to, i.e. unless she
discovers she is impatient. No patient consumer withdraws in t = 1
I provided c 
1

c 2 this assumption is not unreasonable because it
would be irrational for a "patient" consumer to withdraw at t = 1
pretending he is impatient.

58

Bank runs: why can they happen
I suppose a patient consumer anticipates that all other patient

consumers will pretend they are impatient and withdraw c1 at t = 1
I at

t = 1 the bank must then liquidate all its long term investment.
The total amount of resources available to the bank are
(1 π ) c1 + π (c2 /R ) L  c1 if c2 /c1  R/L

I thus for

1  c2 /c1  R/L, if depositors anticipate that a large
enough number of them will want to withdraw early, the bank fails

I note that

1  c2 /c1  R/L always holds for c1  c 2 and
c1  1, c 2  R

I bottom line: bank runs can happen because banks may be

solvent
but illiquid , i.e. their assets are not readily convertible into cash
(here consumption).

59

Bank runs: when can they happen

60

Bank runs: possible remedies

I Narrow banking. The bank invests nothing in the illiquid technology

and stores everything
I

Suspension of convertibility. The bank has the option of stop paying
its depositors when it runs out of cash. This means that any client
who shows up "late" will see her/his deposit transformed from a
demand deposit to a 2-period bond

I

Deposit insurance. The government steps in when the bank runs
out of cash

61

Inside and Outside Liquidity
We have already seen an example of liquidity crises in the model of
"bank runs". Here we discuss a model that further highlights the
importance of liquidity
[ J. Tirole, Illiquidity and all its Friends, mimeo, 2010 and
Inside and Outside Liquidity, MIT Press, 2010]
I

Two types of liquidity
I

I

I

62

inside liquidity: liquidity provided by markets participants
with no outside intervention
outside liquidity: liquidity provided by the government
through its ability to borrow against future tax revenues

Two questions
I

Is inside liquidity su¢ cient, or, in order to prevent liquidation
of otherwise pro…table projects, outside liquidity is needed?

I

Inside liquidity need not only be su¢ cient in the aggregate. It
also needs to be dispatched to those who need it

Liquidity shocks
I

I

Three periods. The interest rate between each two subsequent
periods is zero— meaning that if you do not invest in this
project your alternative is a net return equal to zero.
t=0
I

I

t=1
I

I

I

with probability 1/2 there is an overrun (a "liquidity shock").
An additional quantity, 20, of funds is needed to keep the
project running. Otherwise the project is liquidated and yields
no income in t = 2
with probability 1/2, there is no overrun

t=2
I

I
63

an entrepreneur …nances a project whose initial cost is 10,
borrowing 2 from investors and contributing 8 in equity

provided the overrun, if it happened, has been covered, and
provided the entrepreneur has put enough "e¤ort" in running
his project, this produces a revenue of 30
the revenue, 30, is then shared between the investors and the
entrepreneur

Pleadgeable income (what can be promised to investors)
I

I

I

I

64

in t = 0 the expected contribution of investors to the project
is 2 + (1/2)20 = 12. Assuming there are many investors who
compete with one another, 12 is all that must be promised to
them in t = 0 to bring them in (Remember that the interest
rate is assumed to be zero)
what goes to the entrepreneur, in case of a success, is 18.
Assume that 18 is what is needed to make sure that the
entrepreneur puts enough ”e¤ort” into running the project
(i.e. assume 18 is the amount that solves the incentive
problem we studied in the Holmstrom-Tirole model)
The income the entrepreneur can credibly pledge to outside
investors in t = 0 is thus P = 30 18 = 12 all that remains
goes to the entrepreneur
provided investors are promised 12 in case of success, they will
…nance the project in t = 0 even if they know that (1) it
might need re…nancing and (2) in case of success, 18 will be
turned over to the entrepreneur

Finance as you go
Now we are in t = 1

65

I

if an overrun occurs, the entrepreneur will ask investors to
contribute 20

I

but what looked feasible in t = 0 (remember that investors
were happy to be promised 12 knowing that they might be
asked to cover an overrun) is no longer feasible in t = 1

I

all the entrepreneur can promise is to deliver P = 12 in t = 2
if the project succeeds. If he promised more investors would
understand that he would not run it e¢ ciently

I

but what is needed to keep the project going is 20  12.
Looked at as of t = 1 no investor will cover the overrun and
the project will be abandoned

I

trying to bring in "new" investors, o¤ering them seniority with
respect "old" investors doesn’t help. The project is
abandoned even if the entrepreneur gave 0 to the old investors
and promised P to new ones

Insuring through a credit line
To solve the problem that arises in t = 1 the entrepreneur can buy
insurance from a bank
I in t = 0 the entrepreneur contracts with a bank a credit line
equal to 20. If in t = 1 the overrun occurs, the credit line is
drawn. The bank cannot renege. It pays 20 and becomes the
senior creditor: the old investors get nothing and the bank
gets 12 in t = 2
I in t = 0, to commit to the credit line, the bank asks a fee
equal to 4
I the bank is …ne. It makes zero expected pro…ts: it loses if the
credit line is drawn, it gains if no overrun occurs
4
I

66

I

(1/2)20 + (1/2)12 = 0

in t = 0 investors must now contribute more than 2 (the
di¤erence between the cost of the project and the
entrepreneur’s contribution). Now they must also pay the
bank’s fee. Thus they must contribute 2 + 4 = 6
investors are happy to contribute 6 because 6 = (1/2)12

Insuring through a credit line
I

Alternatively, assume that the bank, rather than being paid a
fee, is paid in shares of the …rm. The …rm issues 4 more
shares (beyond the 2 bought by investors) so that the total
capital of the project is now 6 :
I
I

I

Expected returns (computed as of t = 0) equal the amount of
capital invested. The expected return for investors is 2, equal
to the amount they paid to buy shares. The expected return
of the bank is zero, since the shares were given to the bank for
free (in exchange for its commitment to …nance an overrun):
I
I

67

4 = (2/3)6 is the capital contributed by the bank
2 = (1/3)6 is the capital contributed by investors

investors:(1/2)(1/3)12 + (1/2)(1/3)0 = 2
bank: (1/2) [(2/3)12] + (1/2) [ 20 + 12] = 0

The problem of time inconsistency

68

I

Remember that in t = 1 the bank cannot renege on the credit
line

I

Come t = 1 …nancing the overrun is a money-losing operation:
the bank would not be willing to do it unless it is bound by a
contract— an example of a situation of time inconsistency

I

Thus the credit line must be pre-arranged in t = 0

Macroeconomics

69

I

Where does the bank …nd the 20 it is committed to contribute
to the project in the event of an overrun?

I

Assume that there are many …rms and that their liquidity
shocks are uncorrelated: half face an overrun, half do not. In
other words there is no macroeconomic (or aggregate) shock

I

Is there enough private liquidity in this economy to avoid
ine¢ cient liquidations, or do you need the "government" to
step in to avoid liquidations?

Diversi…cation
I
I

I
I

Assume the number of …rms is normalized to 1
In t = 0 the bank receives 2/3 of the shares of all …rms— in
exchange for the commitment to provide liquidity in t = 1 to
those …rms (1/2 of all …rms) who will need it
In t = 1 the bank, to honor its commitment, needs
(1/2) 20 = 10
The value of the bank’s portfolio (the value of the shares it
owns) is: [(1/2) 12] + [(1/2) (2/3)12] = 10
I [(1/2) 12] is the value of the bank’s shares in the …rms that
I

I
70

have a liquidity shock, where old shareholders will receive
nothing and the bank will receive the entire pledgeable output;
[(1/2) (4/6)12] is the value of the bank’s shares in the …rms
that do not have a liquidity shock, and where the bank will
share pledgeable output with small shareholders

By selling its entire portfolio (assuming the existence of a
market where the bank can do this) the bank obtains enough
liquidity to "recapitalize" half the …rms.

Diversi…cation

If liquidity shocks are uncorrelated there is always enough inside
liquidity and no project will ever be abandoned. What could go
wrong?

71

The need for banking supervision
Inside liquidity need not only be su¢ cient in the aggregate. It
also needs to be dispatched to those who need it
I
I
I

this condition breaks down if banks are not perfectly diversi…ed
in the previous example there is only one bank: shocks cancel
out in the aggregate, thus the bank is perfectly diversi…ed
but consider a situation where there are two …rms and two
banks each extending a credit line to one …rm only
I

I
I

I

72

there is no aggregate liquidity shock: one …rm faces an overrun
and draws on its credit line; the other pays the commitment
fee but does not draw because it has no overrun
one bank makes a pro…t of 4 (the commitment fee), the other
a loss of 4
the …rm which faces an overrun cannot rely on its bank to
…nance it and must fold up its project

there is still enough liquidity in the aggregate, but it is not
dispatched to the …rm that needs it because the bank which
makes a pro…t has no incentive to give it up, transfer it to the
other so that this can deliver on its committed credit line

Liquidity crises: summing up
The lesson from this example is that inside liquidity may be
insu¢ cient to prevent liquidation of otherwise productive projects,
even absent macroeconomic shocks. The government has two ways
to deal with this
I

it can use regulation to make sure that all banks are perfectly
diversi…ed, so that none is exposed to idiosyncratic shocks.
This is the superior, though probably unrealistic solution

I

alternatively, if regulation fails to achieve perfect
diversi…cation, it can step in to provide outside liquidity to
those …rms to which liquidity fails to be dispatched

Why can the government provide "outside liquidity" when the
private sector cannot? Because the government can raise funds in
t = 1 by taxing citizens and promising to pay them back in t = 2
73

Borrowing with collateral, leverage and the ampli…cation
and persistence of real shocks
I

Why and through which channels can the …nancial market
amplify a shock that hits the real economy, for instance a
shock to productivity?

I

Why does leverage arise and how does it amplify shocks

I

Why shocks do not die out immediately— i.e. they are
persistent

Politcal Economy, 1997]

A model of Entrepreneurs and Landlords
I The economy has a …xed quantity of land,

k that can be used to

grow fruit
I Some land is farmed by Entrepreneurs, (E ), the rest of the land is
farmed by Landlords, (L): k L + k E = k
I

I

75

I

Entrepreneurs: their technology to grow fruit is ytE = ak Et 1
with a (which is a measure of their productivity) constant and
relatively high. Thus E have a very e¢ cient technology with
constant returns. But they own no land: to produce they need
to buy the land from landlords
Landlords: have a more traditional decreasing-returns
00
technology: ytL = f (k Lt 1 ), f 0  0, f  0. Decreasing returns
means that their productivity is lower the larger the portion of
land they farm. Thus beyond some point they are willing to
sell their land to E . How much land they farm thus depends
on how much they sell to E . The larger is ktE (the land farmed
by E ) the smaller is the land farmed by L, and thus the higher
its productivity
it takes one period to grow fruit: ktL, 1E produces fruit in t

Entrepreneurs

you buy. In other words

back one period later). This alternative is the opportunity cost (also
called user cost, ut )
