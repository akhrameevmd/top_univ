Quantitative Economics and Econometrics
ECON 2007
Term 2, 2017-2018
Instructor: Áureo de Paula
Office: 228 Drayton House
Office Hour: Thursdays 16:00-18:00 (January) 14:30-15:30 (after January) or by appointment.
Aims: To provide students with a thorough understanding of core techniques of quantitative economics and econometrics and their application to test economic theories and
measure magnitudes relevant for economic policy. The course serves as a foundation for
subsequent study of quantitative topics. Term 2 expands on the topics learned on Term 1
for cross-sectional data and introduces basic concepts in time series models.
Objectives: At the end of the module, students should:
• Understand the main techniques of quantitative economics and econometrics, including
their strengths and limitations.
• Understand how these techniques can be applied to test economic theories and measure
economic magnitudes.
• Have some practical experience of the application of econometric methods using Stata.
Problem Sets:
There will be three problem sets for feedback. Students must hand in all problem sets and
there is no tolerance for late assignments. Additional problems will also be covered in tutorials and the problems will be made available in advance on Moodle.
Practical sessions will take place on Mondays, 10:00-11:00 and are scheduled for TBA. The
practical sessions will be led by TBA
The class will meet on Fridays, 11:00-13:00 at Logan Hall (IOE).
