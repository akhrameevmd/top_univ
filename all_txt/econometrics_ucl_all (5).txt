Introduction
Remember the classical linear regression model:
y = β0 + β1 x + u

(≡ β > x + u using matrix algebra).

For the OLS estimator to be consistent (i.e. to get “close” to β as the
sample increases) we assume
cov(x, u) = 0.

If cov(x, u) 6= 0 we say that x is (econometrically) endogenous.

de Paula (UCL)

ECON 2007: Quantitative Economics and Econometrics

7 / 40

What does cov(x, u) 6= 0 mean?
Let’s think about this in the context of an example:
ln(wage) = β0 + β1 educ + u.
We need to consider what factors are captured by u.
cov (u, educ) = 0 implies no (linear) association between educ and u,
which may incorporate variables such as ability. But more educated
individuals will tend to be more “able”.
Remember that if cov(educ, u) 6= 0, OLS estimators for β0 and β1 are
not consistent.

When could cov(x, u) 6= 0 arise?

Common sources of endogeneity are:
I

Ommited variables

I

Measurement error (i.e. errors-in-variables)

I

Simultaneity

Small detour: unbiasedness 6= consistency!

I

Unbiasedness: small sample; Consistency: large sample.

I

Conditions are different:
E(u|x) = 0 ⇒ cov (x, u) = 0

I

It is not true that cov (x, u) = 0 implies E(u|x) = 0.

I

Intuitively, these two conditions highlight that x and u should be
unrelated. Technically, they are nevertheless different!

I

If you confuse the two in the exam, you will be penalized.

IV Assumptions
Consider the simple regression model
yi = β0 + β1 xi + ui

(2SLS.1)

where cov (u, x) 6= 0
Assume now that we have an instrumental variable zi that satisfies the
following two conditions
I cov (zi , ui ) = 0 (exogeneity or validity)
(+E(ui ) = 0 ⇒ 2SLS.4)
I cov (zi , xi ) 6= 0 (relevance)
(⇐ 2SLS.3)
The exogeneity assumption requires that:
I zi affects yi only through xi
I zi is unrelated to ui
and is not testable (since it involves ui ).
de Paula (UCL)

ECON 2007: Quantitative Economics and Econometrics

12 / 40

IV Assumptions

Instrument relevance requires that zi affect xi
I

It can be verified by estimating the following regression
xi = π 0 + π 1 zi + vi

Since π1 = cov (zi , xi )/var (zi ), we can (and must!) test relevance:
I
I

H0 : π1 = 0: instrument irrelevant
H1 : π1 6= 0: instrument relevant
I

As usual, perform t-test

IV Estimator
Now we can identify β1 by (i) noting that
cov (zi , yi ) = β1 cov (zi , xi ) + cov (zi , ui )
and ii) using the IV assumptions to write
β1 =

cov (zi , yi )
cov (zi , yi )/var (zi )
=
cov (zi , xi )
cov (zi , xi )/var (zi )

which is the slope coefficient estimator from the reduced form divided
by the slope coefficient estimator from the first stage.
Reduced form: cov (zi , yi )/var (zi )
I

slope coefficient from a regression of yi on zi and an intercept

First stage: cov (zi , xi )/var (zi )
I

slope coefficient from a regression of xi on zi and an intercept

IV Estimator
The sample analog is the instrumental variable estimator of β1 :
Pn
(zi − z)(yi − y )
β̂1 = Pi=1
n
i=1 (zi − z)(xi − x)
The IV estimator of β0 is:
βˆ0 = y − βˆ1 x
Note that βˆ1 is the OLS estimator of β1 when zi = xi .
2SLS.1, 3-4 + Random Sampling (2SLS.2) ⇒ 2SLS is consistent.

Special Case of IV: Wald Estimator
A common (and simple) example of IV is one where the instrument is
binary
zi ∈ {0, 1}
Note that
E[yi |zi = 1] = β0 + β1 E[xi |zi = 1]
E[yi |zi = 0] = β0 + β1 E[xi |zi = 0]
so that
E[yi |zi = 1] − E[yi |zi = 0] = β1 (E[xi |zi = 1] − E[xi |zi = 0])
which after rearranging and taking sample analogues gives the Wald
estimator:
y (z=1) − y (z=0)
βˆ1 =
x (z=1) − x (z=0)
P
where x (z=1) ≡ (|{i : zi = 1}|)−1 {i:zi =1} xi , etc.

Example
Consider our example of returns to schooling
ln(wagei ) = β0 + β1 educi + ui
Angrist and Krueger (1991) came up with an instrument for education
in the US: quarter of birth.
Arguments for instrument:
I
I

Education is compulsory by law until your 16th birthday
School start in the year you turn 6:
I
I

I

children born early in the year begin school at an older age
and may therefore leave school with somewhat less education

Quarter of birth is arguably uncorrelated with unobservables
affecting wages (though see Bound, Jaeger and Baker (1995) for
arguments otherwise).

IV vs. OLS
Advantage of IV estimator: Consistent even if u and x are correlated,
in which case the OLS estimator is biased and inconsistent.
Disadvantage of IV estimator: less efficient if u and x are uncorrelated.
Assume that u and x are uncorrelated. Then:
vd
ar (β̂IV ) =

and we can see the variance of the IV estimator

is always larger than the variance of the OLS estimator and

I

depends crucially on the correlation between z and x.

Weak Instruments and Bias
Weak instrument means that z and x are only weakly correlated:
I

not only lead to imprecise IV estimates,

but can also give large bias.

Even if cov (z, u) is smaller than cov (x, u), it is not necessarily better
when the denominator is small.
Even if cov (z, u) = 0, β̂1 becomes very unstable and unreliable if z and
x are only weakly correlated, so that the denominator is close to zero

Weak Instruments and Bias

I

If the IVs are weak, the sampling distribution of the TSLS
estimator (and its t-statistic) is not well approximated by its large n
normal approximation.

I

IV estimation thus requires fairly strong instruments

Rule
of thumb: F-statistic above 10 (same as t-statistic above

3 equations with 3 unknowns: can be solved as we did for OLS

ECON 2007: Quantitative Economics and Econometrics

28 / 40

IV in the MLR model
As before we need z1 to be correlated with x1 , but now over and above
x2 .
We can test this by estimating the following regression
xi1 = π0 + π1 zi1 + π2 xi2 + vi
and instrument relevance is tested as:
H0 : π1 = 0 vs H1 : π1 6= 0
In other words, IV in the MLR model is just as IV in the SLR model
except the exogeneity assumption is now:
cov (zi , ui | xi2 ) = 0
(Note that zi and xi2 can be correlated!)

Two-stage least squares (2SLS)
We still consider the following model
yi = β0 + β1 xi1 + β2 xi2 + ui
but now with M > 1
cov (ui , zim | xi2 ) = 0 m = 1, . . . , M
We only need to modify the first stage such that:
xi1 = π0 + π1 zi1 + . . . + πM ziM + πM+1 xi2 + vi
Instrument relevance is tested using an F statistic for
H0 : π1 = . . . = πM = 0

2SLS: Step-by-step
1. Estimate the first-stage regression:
xi1 = π0 + π1 zi1 + . . . + πM ziM + πM+1 xi2 + vi
- regressing the endogenous explanatory variable on the
instruments and all the other exogenous explanatory variable
2. Compute the predicted value of x1 :
x̂i1 = π̂0 + π̂1 zi1 + . . . + π̂M ziM + π̂M+1 xi2
3. Estimate the second-stage regression:
yi

= β0 + β1 x̂i1 + β2 xi2 + ei

- regressing the outcome variable on x̂i1 and all the other
exogenous explanatory variable
Note that using more than one instrument is not necessary, but it can
give you more efficient IV estimates.

Multiple Endogenous Variables
If there is more than one endogenous variable, e.g.
y1 = β0 + β1 y2 + β2 y3 + β3 z1 + u1
we need at least two exogenous variables z2 and z3 that do not appear
in the equation above. (This is known as the order condition.)
Both of these variables still need to be relevant though. If z2 does not
correlate with either endogenous variable or if both z2 and z3 correlate
with only one of the endogenous variables we would not be able to
identify the desired parameters. The sufficient condition for
identification is called the rank condition. (We will revisit that when we
discuss simultaneous equations.)

Weak IV Revisited
I

Weak IV are also a problem with many instruments.

I

Adding instruments with low predictive power in the first stage
lowers the F -statistic and exacerbates the bias in the 2SLS
estimator.

I

Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1995) illustrate this using the Angrist
and Krueger (1991). AK present results using different sets of IVs
(plus other covariates):
- quarter of birth dummies: M = 3 instruments.
- quarter of birth + (quarter of birth) x (year of birth) dummies:
M = 30 instruments.
- quarter of birth + (quarter of birth) x (year of birth) + (quarter of
birth) x (state of birth): M = 180 instruments.

Weak IV Revisited

With more than one endogenous variable the F -statistic in the first
stage may not suffice for detection of weak IVs either.
One alternative is to perform a test based on the Cragg-Donald
Eigenvalue statistic (see Stock, Wright and Yogo (2002)).

Testing for endogeneity: Hausman test
Consider the simple regression model
yi = β0 + β1 xi1 + ui
Test for endogeneity:
I H0 : cov (xi1 , u) = 0, both OLS and IV are consistent
I H1 : cov (xi1 , u) 6= 0, only IV is consistent and xi1
We perform a Hausman test by
1. Calculating the first-stage residual v̂i (this contains the
endogenous part of xi1 )
xi1 − x̂i1 = v̂i
2. Adding v̂i to the regression model, and estimate by OLS:
yi

= β0 + β1 xi1 + θv̂i + ei

3. Using a t-test to check if θ is significantly different from zero ⇒
reject H0 : cov (xi1 , ui ) = 0

Testing Overidentification Restrictions

I

When there are as many IVs as endogenous variables, exogeneity
of the instruments is not testable.

I

However, when there are more IVs than endogenous variables,
we can test whether some of them are uncorrelated with the u.

I

With two IVs and one endogenous variable, for example, we could
compute alternative 2SLS estimates using each of the IVs. If the
IVs are both exogenous, the 2SLS will converge to the same
parameter and they will differ only by sampling error.

de Paula (UCL)

ECON 2007: Quantitative Economics and Econometrics

37 / 40

Testing Overidentification Restrictions

I

If the two estimates are statistically different, we would not be able
to reject the hypothesis that at least one of the IVs is invalid.

I

But we would not be able to ascertain which one!

I

Moreover, if they are similar and pass the test it could because
both IVs fail the exogeneity requirement.

Testing Overidentification Restrictions

In practice, under homoskedasticity (i.e., E(u 2 |z) = σ 2 ),
1. Estimate coefficients by 2SLS and obtain residuals ûi .
2. Regress ûi on all exogenous variables. Record the R 2 .
3. Under the null hypothesis that all IVs are exogenous, nR 2 ∼ χ2M−1 .
This test can be made robust to heteroskedasticity.
