Binary Response: Logit and Probit
Consider a person’s decision to work or not and record this choice as
y = 1 if the person works and y = 0 otherwise. Let the utility of
working or not working be given by:
u(y ; x, ey ) = βy> x + ey
x: a list of personal characteristics that might affect one’s preference
for work (e.g., number of children, age, non-work income) (absorb the
constant term into x);
βy are parameters that quantify how those personal characteristics
affect the taste for work (β1 ) or leisure (β0 ); and
ey represents unobserved individual taste shifters (independent of x)
that depend on whether someone works (e1 ) or not (e0 ) (because x
contains a constant, assume that E(ey ) = 0).

Binary Response: Logit and Probit
To estimate the probability that a person works (y = 1) we need to
specify a cumulative distribution function G(·) for e. Typically,
economists focus on
I

Normal: G(·) = Φ(·) where
Z z
1
√ exp(−u 2 /2)du, or
Φ(z) =
2π
−∞

I

Logistic: G(·) = Λ(·) where
Λ(z) =

Binary Response: Logit and Probit
These are both bell-shaped, symmetric about zero: G(z) = 1 − G(−z).
Consequently,
Pr (y = 1|x) = Pr (y ∗ > 0|x) = Pr (e > −β > x)
= 1 − G(−β > x) = G(β > x),
which we can use to estimate the parameter vector β.
Because G(·) is a nonlinear function, we cannot use OLS or GLS.
Although we can use modifications of those methods, it is nevertheless
preferrable to use the method of Maximum Likelihood.

Maximum Likelihood Principle
Out of all the possible values of the parameter, the value that makes the
likelihood of the observed data largest should be chosen.
For a single observation i, to calculate the value of the likelihood at a
given parameter value β we need the probability mass function of y
given xi :
f (y |xi ) = [G(β > xi )]y [1 − G(β > xi )](1−y ) , y = 0, 1
with corresponding log-likelihood
li (β) = yi log[G(β > xi )] + (1 − yi ) log[1 − G(β > xi )].

For a random sample with n observations, the log-likelihood function to
be maximized is then given by
L(β) =

n

li (β).

i=1

We cannot write down a closed form solution for the estimator, which
maximizes L(β). Nevertheless, a computer package will (most of the
time) easily compute it and it can be shown to be consistent,
asymptotically normal and efficient.

Binary Response: Logit and Probit
There are three possible routes to test multiple exclusion restrictions
here:
1. Lagrange multiplier or score statistic. Only estimates restricted
model as in linear case.
2. Wald statistic. Only estimates unrestricted model and, under H0 ,
is χ2q where q is the number of restrictions.
3. Likelihood statistic. Estimates both restricted and unrestricted
models and relies on
LR = 2(Lur − Lr )
which, under H0 is χ2q where q is the number of restrictions.

Binary Response: Logit and Probit

In a LPM, since Pr (y = 1|x) = β > x, the estimated coefficient would
give us the direct effect of a covariate xj on Pr (y = 1|x) = p(x).
In a Logit or Probit, β > x = E(y ∗ |x) and β does not have an immediate
interpretation as the latent variable y ∗ does not carry well defined
measurement units.
We need to work a little further to obtain the effect of xj on
p(x) = G(β > x).

I

If xj is discrete, we have to evaluate p(x) at the relevant values for
xj . For example, if xj is a dummy (e.g. representing gender), the
effect of this variable is
G(β0 + β1 x1 + · · · + βj + · · · + βk xk )−
G(β0 + β1 x1 + · · · + 0 + · · · + βk xk )

If xj is continuous, we can use calculus to obtain
∂p(x)
= g(β > x)βj where g(z) ≡ G0 (z).

Binary Response: Logit and Probit
A few remarks:
I

(1) can be generalized for other kinds of discrete variables (see
book);

I

(2) can be generalized for general functional forms among
regressors. For instance,
Pr (y = 1|z) = G(β0 + β1 z1 + β2 z12 + β3 log z2 )
where the partial effect of z1 is ∂Pr (y = 1|z)/∂z1 =
g(β > z)(β1 + 2β2 z1 ) and of z2 is ∂Pr (y = 1|z)/∂z2 = g(β > z)β3 /z2 .

I

Elasticities are given by xj ∂Pr (y = 1|x)/∂xj /Pr (y = 1|x).

I

Be careful with interactions of variables!

I

Watch out for the output of computer packages (which tend to
follow (2)).

Notice that the partial effects now depend on the value of the
regressors. To evaluate those in practice there are two common
alternatives:
I

PEA. Estimate ∂p(E[x])/∂xj by g(β̂ > x)β̂j . Two issues:
1. What does it mean to be “47.5% female”?
2. Averages of functions or functions of averages: age and age2 or
age and age2 ?

APE. Estimate E[∂p(x)/∂xj ] by

These are different from the previous one because ( 1 ) they use exper2
instead of exper2 and ( 2 ) the derivative for exper does not account for exper2

How well do we fit the data? In binary response models there are few
alternatives:
I

Percent Correctly Predicted: predict 1 if G(β̂ > xi ) ≥ 0.5 and 0
otherwise. Check proportion of correct predictions (overall and for
each outcome).

I

Use fraction of successes in-sample as threshold (especially if
number of successes in data is small).

There are many cases in Economics where corner solutions arise.
For example, consider the case of a person deciding how many hours
of work to supply.

Let y represent the number of hours worked. It is (a) continuous over
positive values and (b) is zero with positive probability.
To model E(y |x) we rely (again) on a latent variable y ∗ :
y ∗ = β>x + u

u ∼ N (0, σ 2 )

y = max(c, y ∗ )
where c is a real number (and again we absorb the constant into x.
Notice that, as c → −∞, y ∗ → y .
Here, we will assume that c = 0.

Tobit
Then, we can deduct that
Pr (y = 0|x) = Pr (y ∗ < 0|x) = Pr (u < −β > x|x)
= Pr (u/σ < −β > x/σ|x)
= Φ(−β > x/σ) = 1 − Φ(β > x/σ)
Consequently, the density of y conditional on x = xi is given by
(1/σ)φ[(y − β > xi )/σ], y > 0

1 − Φ(β > xi /σ), y = 0

which we can use to construct a MLE for β!
The MLE maximizes L(β) =

Pn

where

li (β) = 1[yi = 0] log[1 − Φ(β > xi /σ)] +
1[yi > 0] log{(1/σ)φ[(y − β > xi )/σ]}

The coefficient βj gives the partial effect of xj on E(y ∗ |x), but the
observed outcome is instead y .
The conditional expectation of y is given by
E[y |x] = Pr (y > 0|x).E(y |x, y > 0) + 0.Pr (y = 0|x)
= Φ(β > x/σ).[β > x + σλ(β > x/σ)]
= Φ(β > x/σ)β > x + σφ(β > x/σ)
where λ(z) = φ(z)/Φ(z) is called the inverse Mills’ ratio.

There are two partial effects of potential interest:
I

The ’conditonal’ partial effect:
n
o
∂E(y |x, y > 0)/∂xj = βj 1 + λ0 (β > x/σ)
o
n
= βj 1 − λ(β > x/σ)[β > x/σ + λ(β > x/σ)]

I

The ’unconditional’ partial effect:
∂E(y |x)/∂xj

= ∂Pr (y > 0|x)/∂xj .E(y |x, y > 0)
+Pr (y > 0|x).∂E(y |x, y > 0)/∂xj
= βj Φ(β > x/σ)

These can be estimated as PEA or APE in the Probit or Logit cases.

The Tobit model has a few important limitations.
I

The effect of xj on E(y |x, y > 0) and Pr (y > 0|x) are both
proportional to βj .
This rules out situation in which xj affects both objects in different
directions. For instance, the effect of a person’s age on the
amount of life insurance. Younger people may be less likely to buy
life insurance, so Pr (y > 0|x) increases with age. Conditional on
having a policy, its value may nonetheless decrease with age, as
people get near the end of their lives. In this case, E(y |x, y > 0)
would decrease with age. (For a informal specification test using
probits, see book.)
