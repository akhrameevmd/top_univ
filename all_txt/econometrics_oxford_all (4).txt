The Simple Regression Model

“The simple regression model can be used to study the relationship
between two variables [...] It has limitations as a general tool for
empirical analysis. Nevertheless it is sometimes appropriate as an
empirical tool. (Moreover) Learning how to interpret the simple
regression model is good practice for studying multiple regression,”
Wooldridge (2013) p. 20

The Simple Regression Model
Examples (Stock and Watson, 2012, p. 149)
I

A state implements tough new penalties on drunk drivers:
What is the effect on highway fatalities?

I

A school district cuts the size of its elementary school
classes: What is the effect on its students’ standardized test
scores?

I

You successfully complete one more year of college classes:
What is the effect on your future earnings?

The Simple Regression Model

yi = β1 + β2 xi + ui ,
I

yi and xi are observable random scalars

I

ui is the unobservable random disturbance or error

I

β1 and β2 are the parameters (constants) we would like to
estimate

Multiple Regression Analysis

The Multiple Regression Model

yi = β1 x1i + β2 x2i + β3 x3i + ... + βK xKi + ui
Example:
wagei = β1 + β2 educi + β3 experi + ui
