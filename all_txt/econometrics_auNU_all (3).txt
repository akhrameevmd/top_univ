EMET4305/8005

Economic Models and Introductory
Econometrics
This is a unit in basic econometrics, emphasising the problems involved in the empirical
measurement of economic relationships and the techniques used to solve these problems.
While the application of econometric techniques is of prime importance, the results are not
just presented but derived using a mixture of rigour and intuition so as to leave as few
loose ends as possible.

COURSE OVERVIEW
Learning Outcomes
The main objective of this course is to provide students with an introduction to econometric
methods needed for graduate level empirical analysis in economics and related
disciplines. At the end of this course, students will:
•

•

be able to conduct a basic empirical analysis of cross sectional data (observations on
characteristics of several economic units, such as firms or households, at a single point
in time) or time series data (observations on characteristics of one economic unit over
time);
have sufficient background to take EMET8001 Applied Micro-Econometrics or
EMET8010 Applied Macro and Financial Econometrics or EMET8002 Case Studies in
Applied Econometrics in the second semester.

Feedback
Staff Feedback
Students will be given feedback in the following forms in this course: written comments,
verbal comments, feedback to the whole class and to tutorial groups.
Student Feedback
ANU is committed to the demonstration of educational excellence and regularly seeks feedback
from students. One of the key formal ways students have to provide feedback is through Student
Experience of Learning Support (SELS) surveys. The feedback given in these surveys is
anonymous and provides the Colleges, University Education Committee and Academic Board with
opportunities to recognise excellent teaching, and opportunities for improvement.
For more information on student surveys at ANU and reports on the feedback provided on ANU
courses, go to
http://unistats.anu.edu.au/surveys/selt/students/ and
http://unistats.anu.edu.au/surveys/selt/results/learning/

Policies
ANU has educational policies, procedures and guidelines, which are designed to ensure
that staff and students are aware of the University’s academic standards, and implement
them. You can find the University’s education policies and an explanatory glossary at:
http://policies.anu.edu.au/

2 | THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY

Students are expected to have read the Student Academic Integrity Policy before the
commencement of their course.
Other key policies include:
• Student Assessment (Coursework)
• Student Surveys and Evaluations
Required Resources
Commonwealth supported students and domestic full-fee paying students generally must
be able to complete the requirements of their program of study without the imposition of
fees that are additional to the student contribution amount or tuition fees.
Provided that its payment is in accordance with the Act, a fee is of a kind that is into any one or
more of the following categories:
(a) It is a charge for a good or service that is not essential to the course of study.
(b) It is a charge for an alternative form, or alternative forms, of access to a good or service that is
an essential component of the course of study but is otherwise made readily available at no
additional fee by the higher education provider.
(c) It is a charge for an essential good or service that the student has the choice of acquiring from a
supplier other than the higher education provider and is for:
(i) equipment or items which become the physical property of the student and are not consumed
during the course of study; or
(ii) food, transport and accommodation costs associated with the provision of field trips that form
part of the course of study.
(d) It is a fine or a penalty provided it is imposed principally as a disincentive and not in order to
raise revenue or cover administrative costs.

Additional course costs
EViews econometric software will be used in this course. A Student version of the software may be
purchased separately.
Examination material or equipment
The relevant information will be posted on Wattle.

ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS

The ANU is using Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to
assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing
Academic Integrity. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the ANU
Online website.
Students may choose not to submit assessment items through Turnitin. In this instance
you will be required to submit, alongside the assessment item itself, copies of all
references included in the assessment item.
As a further academic integrity control, students may be selected for a 15 minute individual
oral examination of their written assessment submissions.
Any student identified, either during the current semester or in retrospect, as having used
ghost writing services will be investigated under the University’s Academic Misconduct
Rule.
Assessment Tasks
Assignments
There will be two assignments in this course. The due dates for these assignments will be posted
on Wattle.
4 | THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY

Examination(s)
The mid-semester exam would contain multiple choice and short-answer/calculation type questions
based on topics covered in the assignments and lectures. Students who miss the test for valid and
documented medical reasons will have the value of the test added to the value of the final
examination.
Assignment submission

Online Submission: Assignments are submitted using Turnitin in the course Wattle site.
You will be required to electronically sign a declaration as part of the submission of your
assignment. Please keep a copy of the assignment for your records.
Extensions and penalties
Extensions and late submission of assessment pieces are covered by the Student Assessment
(Coursework) Policy and Procedure.
The Course Convener may grant extensions for assessment pieces that are not examinations or takehome examinations. If you need an extension, you must request it in writing on or before the due date. If
you have documented and appropriate medical evidence that demonstrates you were not able to request
an extension on or before the due date, you may be able to request it after the due date.
Late submission of assessment tasks without an extension are penalised at the rate of 5% of the possible
marks available per working day or part thereof. Late submission of assessment tasks is not accepted
after 10 working days after the due date, or on or after the date specified in the course outline for the
return of the assessment item.
Late submission is not accepted for take-home examinations.
Returning assignments
The dates for returning the assignments will be posted on Wattle.

Announcements
Students are expected to check the Wattle site for announcements about this course, e.g. changes
to timetables or notifications of cancellations.

Scaling
Your final mark for the course will be based on the raw marks allocated for each of your
assessment items. However, your final mark may not be the same number as produced by
that formula, as marks may be scaled. Any scaling applied will preserve the rank order of
raw marks (i.e. if your raw mark exceeds that of another student, then your scaled mark
will exceed the scaled mark of that student), and may be either up or down.
Privacy Notice
The ANU has made a number of third party, online, databases available for students to
use. Use of each online database is conditional on student end users first agreeing to the
database licensor’s terms of service and/or privacy policy. Students should read these
carefully.
5 | THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY

In some cases student end users will be required to register an account with the database
licensor and submit personal information, including their: first name; last name; ANU email
address; and other information.
In cases where student end users are asked to submit ‘content’ to a database, such as an
assignment or short answers, the database licensor may only use the student’s ‘content’ in
accordance with the terms of service – including any (copyright) licence the student grants
to the database licensor.
Any personal information or content a student submits may be stored by the licensor,
potentially offshore, and will be used to process the database service in accordance with
the licensors terms of service and/or privacy policy.
If any student chooses not to agree to the database licensor’s terms of service or privacy
policy, the student will not be able to access and use the database. In these
circumstances students should contact their lecturer to enquire about alternative
arrangements that are available.
Tutorial Seminar Registration
Tutorial signup for this course will be done via the Wattle website. Detailed information
