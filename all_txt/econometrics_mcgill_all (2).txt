Introductory Econometrics II

Instructor:

Hours:

To be arranged

Textbook:

Some material will be on WEB CT. Forecasting Methods and Applications by
Makridakis, Wheelwright, and Hyndman, as well as some other books, will be
put on reserve in the library.

Students should have the equivalent of ECON 337 to take this course, namely familiarity with
simple and multiple regression , together with a bit of matrix technique, principally through
EXCEL. Some knowledge of calculus is highly desirable. The main thrust of the course is
forecasting methods, although some additional topics appear. Some real data sets, including the
well-known Box-Jenkins airline data, will be used for examples and problems. Work will be
done using statistics software, such as MINITAB and EXCEL.
