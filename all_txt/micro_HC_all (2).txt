Tutorials: TBD
Course Description: Intermediate Microeconomic Theory is one of the most important
courses in the undergraduate economics curriculum. It is the basis for any other more
advanced courses in economics – both micro and macro.
You will learn the basic analytical tools of microeconomic theory, which means being able
to define, recognize, illustrate and interpret microeconomic concepts algebraically,
graphically and conceptually. We will illustrate the usefulness of these analytical tools
through engaging and relevant examples. You will develop the ability to creatively apply
these analytical tools to collective and individual questions.
Prerequisites include basic microeconomics, calculus, and linear algebra.
Readings: For textbook, we will be using Microeconomics, by David Besanko and Ronald
R. Braeutigam, the international student version, 5th edition.
It is also acceptable if students use older versions of the textbook. However, it is your
responsibility to keep the materials and problem sets updated.

Method of Evaluation: Participation (5%), Homework Assignments (10%), Quizzes (10%),
Midterm (30%), Final (45%).

Participation: Participation will be graded based on attendance and contribution to the class.
Lecture attendance is mandatory. However, I do not take attendance. You may want to
notify me in advance or give me a note afterward for any medical emergency, religious
holiday, field trip and athletic contest, which are the only valid excuses for an absence from
quiz and examination.
Communication is highly valued in this class. I encourage you to ask questions and
express your thoughts during lectures and tutorials. There is no such thing as a stupid question.
When necessary, I will randomly choose a name to answer my question and/or to speak up.
One can lose one participation point if she/he is absent without a valid excuse or refuses to
speak.
In addition, courtesy is expected in classroom. In particular, you should refrain from chitchatting, making loud noises, or playing with electronic devices during lectures. You can
also lose participation points if your behavior is disruptive to the class.
Tutorials: Tutorials are an integral part of the course, and students are expected to attend.
We will use them to expand on ideas presented in the text and in the lectures, to discuss
homework problems and quizzes, and to provide an opportunity for you to ask questions
about anything that you would like to clarify.
We will hold 5-6 tutorials throughout the semester. The exact dates are TBD.
Examination: The midterm exam is scheduled to be held in class on October 17 (Tuesday).
The centrally-planned final examination is TBD. The final exam is NOT cumulative.
However, due to the nature of the knowledge learned in this class, for the final exam, you
are expected to know basic concepts and skills learned before the midterm.
Group Homework: We will have 5 homework assignments, usually one for every three
chapters. Each homework accounts for 2% of your course grade. The main purpose of these
problems is to help you learn the material. So, each homework consists of 5 to 7 problems
that will be graded (and that you need to submit) and many other suggested problems that
you should do for practice.
You should turn in each assignment in group of 4 students. Group formation will be done
before the third week of class. Late assignments will not be accepted.
Quizzes: We will have 5 in-class quizzes (usually one for every other week). Quizzes are to
check if you are doing the assigned reading and you learn the material presented in class.
Detailed dates will be announced later. I will drop your lowest quiz score, so each quiz accounts
for 2.5% of your course grade.
Extra Credits: There will be extra-credit opportunities throughout the semester. I will only
make those announcements during lecture.

Students with Special Needs: If you have a documented disability and need special
accommodations, please see me as soon as possible.
Academic Honesty: Attention is drawn to University policy and regulations on honesty in
academic work, and to the disciplinary guidelines and procedures applicable to breaches of
such policy and regulations. Details may be found at http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/policy/academichonesty/.
The sample statement is as follows, can be downloaded at 
http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/policy/academichonesty/Eng_htm_files_(2013‐14)/declaration_en.doc. 
 
I am submitting the assignment for:  
□ an individual project or  
□ a group project on behalf of all members of the group. It is hereby confirmed that the submission 
is authorized by all members of the group, and all members of the group are required to sign this 
declaration.  
I/We declare that: (i) the assignment here submitted is original except for source material explicitly 
acknowledged; (ii) the piece of work, or a part of the piece of work has not been submitted for more 
than one purpose (e.g. to satisfy the requirements in two different courses) without declaration; and 
(iii)  the  submitted  soft  copy  with  details  listed  in  the  <Submission  Details>  is  identical  to  the  hard 
copy(ies), if any, which has(have) been / is(are) going to be submitted.  
I/We  also  acknowledge  that  I  am/we  are  aware  of  University  policy  and  regulations  on  honesty  in 
academic work, and of the disciplinary guidelines and procedures applicable to breaches of such policy and 
regulations, as contained in the University website http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/policy/academichonesty/.  
In the case of a group project, we are aware that each student is responsible and liable to disciplinary 
actions  should  there  be  any  plagiarized  contents/undeclared  multiple  submission  in  the  group 
project,  irrespective  of  whether  he/she  has  signed  the  declaration  and  whether  he/she  has 
contributed directly or indirectly to the problematic contents. 
It is also understood that assignments without a properly signed declaration by the student concerned 
and in the case of a group project, by all members of the group concerned, will not be graded by the 
teacher(s).
