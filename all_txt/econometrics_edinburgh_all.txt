Course
description

Essentials of Econometrics (EE) provides an opportunity
to learn skills that are important for later stages of the
Economics programme, and many future career and life
contexts. EE aims to ensure that all economics honours
students have a sound grasp of the basic techniques of
modern empirical economics.
The topics covered are likely to include: statistics
(review of probability distributions, statistical
inference, estimation and hypothesis testing); the
linear regression model (two-variable model, multiple
regression, functional forms, dummy variables);
regression analysis in practice (model selection criteria
and tests, multicollinearity, heteroskedasticity,
autocorrelation).
EE includes weekly lab sessions to reinforce lectures,
with exercises which foster 'learning-by-doing'. The
course provides an opportunity to develop and practice
key practical skills in computing, data gathering,
processing, analysis and presentation.
