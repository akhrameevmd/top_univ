Consumption smoothing and financial markets
In practice:
 Lending rates are higher than
borrowing rates, and vary across
individuals and time (CORE Unit 11)

So the PIH also assumes that

 Some households are credit
constrained i.e. the amount they can
borrow is limited
 more details in lecture 8

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 2

Slide 2

Consumption with credit constraints
News about an increase in income from y1
to y2 at time t+1 is announced at time t

So if (for example) 50% of households
are credit constrained and 50% credit
unconstrained, aggregate consumption
will be:

“Hand-to-mouth” behaviour
There is evidence that some
households simply consume their
current income.

For such households, consumption will
simply be equal to current income

Pre-tax and after-tax income
y represents households disposable
income i.e. after tax

And lifetime wealth:


If instead y represented pre-tax
income, would need to replace y in the
above slides with (1-t)y where t is the
proportional tax rate.

Application: the multiplier as an empirical concept
Definition:

Measuring the government spending
multiplier:

Δy/Δz where z is something exogenous
e.g. the government spending multiplier
Δy/Δg “how much does output change as
a result of an exogenous change in
government spending”
Why does this matter?

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 2

 difficult to estimate because of reverse
causation – government spending both
reacts to and affects output…
 …and because different episodes
might not be comparable
 a rough rule of thumb is the multiplier
in normal times is between 0 and 1.5
 some evidence of negative multipliers
“expansionary fiscal contractions”

Slide 8

Application: the multiplier in theory
Take the consumption function
c = co (Ʌ)+ cy(Ʌ)(1-t)y
Substitute it into the aggregate demand
equation:
ad = c + v +g =
Assume the goods market clears so
y = ad then

So theoretically the government
spending multiplier is:

If all agents follow the PIH:

yield a stream of future services.

The q theory of investment
Firms choose the level of their capital
stock to maximise their value:

The benefit of investing a unit of revenue
is:

Capital depreciates over time at rate δ

Instead define average Q as

…or can use Q to judge whether the
stock market is under or over-valued.
… simply need to calculate the ratio on
the RHS of the expression for Q. If it’s
> 1 this means:

Q = Stock market value of firm / Replacement 1.
cost of capital
Can show under certain conditions (perfect
competition) q = Q

Empirical evidence on investment
Prediction of q theory:
 investment by firms is sensitive to the
real interest rate

Prediction of q theory:
 investment by firms is (largely)
independent of current cashflow
 why?

The evidence
 measurement issues
 weak negative or no effect

The evidence
 investment is sensitive to cashflow

Investment and animal spirits
“a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than on a
mathematical expectation, whether moral or hedonistic or economic. Most, probably, of our
decisions to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many
days to come, can only be taken as a result of animal spirits — of a spontaneous urge to action
rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits
multiplied by quantitative probabilities. Enterprise only pretends to itself to be mainly actuated
by the statements in its own prospectus, however candid and sincere. Only a little more than an
expedition to the South Pole, is it based on an exact calculation of benefits to come. Thus if the
animal spirits are dimmed and the spontaneous optimism falters, leaving us to depend on
nothing but a mathematical expectation, enterprise will fade and die; — though fears of loss
may have a basis no more reasonable than hopes of profit had before…individual initiative will
only be adequate when reasonable calculation is supplemented and supported by animal spirits,
so that the thought of ultimate loss which often overtakes pioneers, as experience undoubtedly
tells us and them, is put aside as a healthy man puts aside the expectation of death”

 we wrote that equation as if the firm
knew all the quantities on the left
hand side
 is a firm able to form expectations of
the long-horizon state of technology
or the marginal product of capital?
 See lecture 5 for more on “deep
uncertainty”

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 2

 most new firms fail; most investments
lose money (though they can deliver
social benefits in the process)
 given all this, investment only happens
if investors have “spontaneous optimism
…animal spirits —a spontaneous urge to
action”… which seems quite a good
characterisation of entrepreneurs.
 Schumpeterian growth (CORE Unit
2,12)
 one explanation of why investment
might be only weakly dependent on
interest rates

Household investment
Consumer durables:

Housing:

 purchase produces a stream of utility
in the form of future services

 purchase produces a stream utility in
the form of future housing services

 often funded with debt.

 usually funded with debt (mortgages)

 easily deferred if debt is hard to obtain

 negatively related to interest rates

 negatively related to interest rates

 outside option is renting
 is housing wealth net worth? An
increase in house prices means the
value of housing services increases. A
household can only realise such wealth
if they consume less housing services.

Goods market equilibrium: The IS curve
ad = c + v + g

 assume goods market equilibrium y = ad

 the demand side will be summarised by
the IS curve, a relation between current
real interest rates and current income
 consumption is c= c(Ʌ c) where Ʌ c are
the variables that determine non-durable
consumption
 among these are real interest rates and
current output so write
ct  c0 c   cy c yt  cr c rt
 similarly for investment by firms and
households

vt  v0 v   v y v yt  vr v rt

ECON2004 Macroeconomic Theory and Policy. Lecture 2

 a fall in interest rates causes interestrate sensitive components of
consumption and investment to rise so
increasing output directly
 this has a multiplier effect increasing
output further

What determines the slope of the
curve?
 The interest sensitivity of non-durable
and durable consumption, housing
investment and investment by firms
 The size of the multipliers for
consumption and investment

What shifts the curve?
 Changes in Ʌc, Ʌv and g (exogenous
government spending)
 See problem set 1 q 3 for the algebra
