What is a Matrix?
I

There are many books on Matrix Algebra

I

The material in this pdf is based on: Econometric Analysis
by Greene (Appendix A)

aik stands for arow,col so that i = 1, ..., n and j = 1, ..., K

I

A is an n

I

If K = 1, A becomes a column vector

I

If n = 1, A becomes a row vector

Some special matrices

I

Symmetric matrix: a matrix that has aik = aki for all i and k;
e.g.,
2
3
3 2 9
A=4 2 1 6 5
9 6 5

Diagonal matrix: a square matrix that has only nonzero
entries on the main diagonal; e.g.,
2
3
3 0 0
A=4 0 1 0 5
0 0 5

Some special matrices

I

Scalar matrix: a diagonal matrix with the same value in all
diagonal elements; e.g.,
2
3
9 0 0
A=4 0 9 0 5
0 0 9
Identity matrix: a scalar matrix with ones on the diagonal;
e.g.,
2
3
1 0 0
A=4 0 1 0 5
0 0 1

if A = 4 4 5 6 5 then A0 = 4 2 5 8 5

Note if A is symmetric then A = A0

A + B = [aij + bij ] or A

B = [aij

Adding the zero (or null) matrix: A + 0 = A
Commutative: A + B = B + A
Associative: (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)

Inverse of a square Matrix: Let A be a square matrix
(n n). The inverse matrix, denoted A 1 , is defined such
that
A 1 A = AA 1 = I

A=

where

jAj = a11 a22

a12 a21

is the determinant of A. So if jAj = 0, then A is not
invertible

Determinant of a square Matrix: A practical definition
(Laplace): Let A be a K K matrix. For any row i,

jAj =

K
P

k =1

aik ( 1)i+k jAik j

where jAik j is a minor of A, i.e., the determinant of Aik
where Aik is the matrix obtained after deleting row i and
column k
I
I

Cik = ( 1)i+k jAik j is known as a cofactor
Example: If

A=

a11 a12
a21 a22

then jAj = a11 a22

a12 a21

Rank of a Matrix: The rank of a matrix, denoted rank(A),
is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or
columns

I

rank(A) = rank(A0 )

I

A matrix A is full rank if its rank is equal to the number of
columns it contains

I

rank(AB)

I

If A is M n and B is a square matrix with rank(B) = n,
then rank(AB) = rank(A)

I

Important: rank(A) = rank(A0 A) = rank(AA0 )

I

Proposition: jAj 6= 0 if and only if it has full rank

min(#rows, #cols)

min(rank(A), rank(B))

a11 a12
a21 a22

if jAj = a11 a22 a12 a21 6= 0, then rank(A) = 2
if jAj = 0 because A = 0, then rank(A) = 0
otherwise (that is if A 6= 0 and jAj = 0), then rank(A) = 1

Quadratic forms and Definite Matrices

I

A quadratic form: q = x0 Ax where A is a symmetric matrix

I

Positive Definite: A is positive definite if x0 Ax > 0 for all
nonzero x

I

Negative Definite: A is positive definite if x0 Ax < 0 for all
nonzero x

I

Positive Semidefinite: A is positive semidefinite if
x0 Ax 0 for all nonzero x (var-cov matrices)

I

Negative Semidefinite: A is negative semidefinite if
x0 Ax 0 for all nonzero x
