Written Assignments:
There are no course/term paper requirements or problem sets.
Examinations:
There will be three midterm tests and a final examination, as noted on the reading/assignment schedule. Questions will
include multiple choice, short answers, graphing, problems, interpretations and essays. Copies of previous Economics
198 examinations for the last five times the course has been offered are available for purchase in SS101 and on-line via
Chalk.
Grading:
The final course grade will be determined on the basis of performance on the four independent examinations. Each test
is weighted equally. Students will be allowed to drop the lowest of the four scores. There are no make-up exams; if a
student misses a test then his/her grade will be based on the other three exams. Students may not take an Incomplete. If
a student withdraws from the course after Week 3 and is not passing at that time, then he/she will receive a WF.
In addition, students are expected to have completed assigned readings before each session. Some consideration in
grading will be given for productive contributions to class discussions.
