Applied Econometrics: Mostly Harmless Big Data

Spring 2017

This course covers empirical strategies for applied micro research. Our agenda includes regression and
matching, instrumental variables, differences-in-differences, regression discontinuity designs, standard
errors, and the analysis of high-dimensional data sets, a.k.a. big data.
Course requirements and grading: Students are expected to do the readings. In addition, there are three
graded problem sets, which must be submitted on time to be graded for credit (the course is graded
pass/fail). The atmosphere is informal, but we ask you to put all electronic devices away when class is in
session. We encourage questions and class discussion – we’ll be asking you questions too!
We use the following text:
