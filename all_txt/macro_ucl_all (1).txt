Model-building:
The medium-run open economy model (AD-ERU model)
• What determines the medium-run real exchange rate? Supply and
demand shocks and policies (independent of exchange rate
regime) 
• What determines the medium-run inflation rate? Monetary policy
(i.e. exchange rate) regime …

Fixed exchange rates:  MRE   *
Flexible exchange rates:  MRE   T

Summary: the medium run model (AD-ERU)
• What are the variables on the axes?
• Demand side represented by AD curve,
incorporates
• Supply side represented by ERU curve
incorporates WS=PS
• In MRE, economy is
• ON an AD curve and ON an ERU curve
• inflation is constant
• real exchange rate is constant

Why is the open economy different?
One obvious change in the open economy

A more subtle change will be needed:
“The dollar rose the most against the euro in a month on
speculation government reports tomorrow will show faster inflation
in the U.S., underscoring the potential for the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates more than some traders had expected.”

Which exchange
rate regime?

Fixed – see common
currency area later

Flexible

Is monetary policy
available for
stabilization?

Yes, CB adjusts r, &
q jumps

No, why not?
Use fiscal policy or

The structure of the 3-equation closed economy model
CB minimizes its loss function, which expresses its objectives

subject to the constraint from the supply side, in the Phillips curve

which produces the monetary rule function that pins down the
optimal output gap

which is implemented through choice of r using the IS equation
(best-response Taylor Rule)

What is the RX curve?
Remember this step in the closed economy?
the optimal monetary rule function pins down the optimal output
gap,
which is implemented through choice of r using the IS equation

In the open economy, the same step is:

the optimal monetary rule function pins down the optimal output
gap, which is implemented through choice of r using the IS equation
& taking account of the reaction of the forward-looking forex market

Modelling forward-looking behaviour
Questions:

How does forex market analyse the CB’s optimal reaction to a shock?
How does the CB analyse the forex market’s reaction to a shock?

Puzzle (example of inflation shock):
If forex market knows CB will set r above r* for some time;
it will expect exchange rate ____________,
which means q will ____________ immediately … but this will
__________ output and mean the CB has to raise r by less … but in
this case the ___________ will be less and the CB will have to raise r
by more
Q: How much does CB raise r and by how much does q jump?

Modelling forward-looking behaviour
Answer:
Both solve the same problem; both use the same model; the model
assumes both have

Tasks:
1. Doing the maths to derive the RX equation … next week
2. Practising the logic and integrating with the AD-ERU model – so
far, we have concentrated on an inflation shock but what about
supply & demand shocks?

Demand & supply shocks: 3 equation model & AD-ERU model
From AD-ERU model, we know that
• permanent demand & supply shocks affect medium-run real
exchange rate, q
• supply shocks affect equilibrium output, ye

Why does this matter?
CB and forex market need to calculate new MRE q and new ye for the
output gap
UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 3

Why didn’t we worry about this
with an inflation shock? 22

Example: negative demand shock
“Sterling had lost over a quarter of its value since mid-2007. To some degree, that
depreciation had probably reflected the need to rebalance the UK economy away
from domestic towards external demand. In addition over the past year, the global
outlook had deteriorated with resultant downward revisions to interest rate
expectations worldwide. But the downward revision to forecasts of the UK
economy appeared to have been greater than for some other countries. And those
perceptions may have contributed to sterling's decline.”
Bank of England, Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting, 4 and 5 March 2009

Behaviour of UK exchange rate in context of global financial crisis
suggests forex market saw a specific problem for the UK
• the permanent disappearance of some _________ demand
(revealed as unsustainable)
• need for permanent shift toward ____________
• not just a temporary crisis-related demand shock

Example: negative demand shock
Using the model to dissect the BoE’s statement
“Sterling had lost over a quarter of its value since mid-2007.
To some degree, that depreciation had probably reflected the need to rebalance
the UK economy away from domestic towards external demand.”

[Model: MRE q is depreciated]

“In addition over the past year, the global outlook had deteriorated with resultant
downward revisions to interest rate expectations worldwide.”

[Model: likely fall in r*]
“But the downward revision to forecasts of the UK economy appeared to have
been greater than for some other countries.”

[Model: expect BoE to cut r relative to r*]
“And those perceptions may have contributed to sterling's decline.”

Central bank reaction to a negative demand shock
1. Output falls to B on new IS
2. Inflation falls to B on PC
3. CB & forex market calculate CB’s
optimal output gap on MR curve at C
4. RX shows how much r must be cut
below r* : C on RX
5. IS shifts by equilibrium depreciation
plus extra depreciation to
take IS to C

CB gradually raises r back to r* along
RX (as expected)
Since r  r * from C to Z, q
appreciates as expected and IS
moves to the left

the CB calculate the right interest rate change in response to a
