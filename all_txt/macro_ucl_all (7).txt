Success of the ECB
Divergence in member countries … remember different motives for joining

Before the global financial crisis (2008):
Common characteristic of the crisis countries: current account deficit
2 types of vulnerability to a debt crisis:
Type 1. Private sector indebtedness
Type 2. Excessive government deficits before the crisis
After the global financial crisis
Common characteristics of the crisis countries: government debt problems
• Current account deficit
• High level of government debt
• Attacked by the ‘bond vigilantes’
• Doubts about solvency … can government honour its bonds?

Why is a member of a CCA vulnerable to a sovereign debt
crisis? The role of governance arrangements
Q: why did the default risk disappear?
A:
Governance in the Eurozone:
• Government to government
• ECB to government
• Fiscal rules
 view that it was unnecessary to have supra-national government
Compare relationships among banks – government(s) – central
bank in a nation state with those in the Eurozone

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 10

Governance arrangements in a nation state



CB is lender of last resort (LOLR) to commercial banks: liquidity
support. Solvency support for comm. banks rests on gov’t.



Key: CB is LOLR to Govt. → CB may mitigate fear of govt. debt
default by printing money to buy govt. bonds → ↓ Risk premium.

What happened to end the panic?

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 10

The Eurozone’s problematic governance structure
Draghi’s speech of 26th July 2012: “the only way out of this present crisis is to have more
Europe, not less Europe. A Europe that is founded on four building blocks: a fiscal union, a
financial [banking] union, an economic union and a political union.”

•
•
•
•

Citizens of member countries
Governments of member countries
Central Bank of the Eurozone
Banking system – cross-border banks including countries outside
Eurozone; national governments responsible for solvency; ECB for
liquidity
“Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve
the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.”

Reform proposals for governance in the Eurozone
Political union

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 10

12

The Eurozone crisis – policy steps
• ECB – massive injection of liquidity … to support the banks; the banks
bought government debt … + Draghi statement  panic receded … the
risk premia fell … solvency of governments improved; but weak growth
& fear of deflation  QE (2015); additional measures 2016
• See http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/2016/03/13/the-end-of-negativerates-but-not-cental-bank-alchemy/ for an excellent summary

The Eurozone crisis – policy steps (cont.)
• Eurozone – bail-outs for Greece, Ireland, Portugal accompanied by
harsh fiscal austerity conditions (refer back to Lecture 8 for Greece)
• Eurozone – fiscal compact (like the SGP but more stringent; harsher
penalties; external surveillance of national budgets; and MIP)
• Eurozone – ‘banking union’ – arrangements for the resolution of failing
banks. Limited backstop will be provided but not full mutualisation.
Problem: where will growth come from? Think of the sector balances … if
the government sector goes toward surplus (plans to save more), for
growth not to fall, one or both of the following must happen:
• private sector 
• external sector (X-M) 

Great Depression, macro models & policy regime

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 10

18

Post - Great Depression paradigm & policy regime shift

New Paradigm – Keynes’ economics
• Explanation for persistence of mass unemployment
• New ‘general’ theory to encompass the full employment equilibrium of
classical theory as special case
• Weakness of economy’s self-stabilizing mechanisms meant
stabilization policy was necessary
New Policy Regime
• national – demand-management
• international – Bretton Woods
2 decades of growth & stability – the Golden Age (see Unit 17 in CORE
ebook)
UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 10

19

Seeds of the Stagflation crisis
• Low U and increased economic security via expansion of the welfare
state  shift in bargaining power to labour (strikes)
• By late 1960s, wage push (profit squeeze) and higher equilibrium U;
exacerbated by weakening labour productivity growth and then by
commodity and oil price shocks in 1970s

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 10

20

Problems for the prevailing paradigm (Keynesian economics
e.g. IS/LM & Mundell-Fleming models) & policy regime
• Supply-side effects on equilibrium unemployment neglected
• Consequence that macroeconomic policy was oriented to sustaining
aggregate demand
• Using prevailing models of inflation, such policy intervention was
forecast to be effective (remember 1973 oil shock)

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 10

21

Post - Great Stagflation paradigm shift
A research programme comprising
• a methodology (the origins of DSGE models studied in MSc macro
courses – see Chapter 16 of CS2015)
• new classical assumptions of perfect competition, rational
expectations, flexible prices (the neoclassical growth model)
• a single model to describe growth and cycles – technology shocks 
RBC (Real Business Cycle) models

Problem for RBC models to explain persistence in inflation;
unemployment costs of disinflation
 New Keynesian (NK) model
combines RBC methods with sticky P, W
summarized in a 3-equation model for policy analysis: IS, PC, MR (similar
to the model we have studied)
UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 10

22

Post - Great Stagflation policy regime shift
New Policy Regime (national & international)
• Inflation targeting central banks
• No international coordination – flexible exchange rates and capital
mobility
2 decades of growth & stability – the Great Moderation
Seeds of the next crisis
• Low U but rising inequality (wage squeeze)
• Financial liberalization
• Interdependent global growth patterns – export-based (China &
Germany) + finance-based (US, UK)

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 10

25

Problems for the prevailing paradigm (RBC & NK
macroeconomics e.g. 3-equation model) & policy regime
(inflation-targeting CBs)
Problems for the paradigm
• NK-type models do not have banks etc. in the model – that is why you
studied Chapters 5-7
& policy regime
• Inflation targeting macro regime (called ‘Taylor Rule’ macro) was
consistent with stable inflation alongside growing leverage and
growing global financial imbalances
• Success of inflation targeting regime reduced macro risk & fuelled
leverage cycle (expansion of household and bank debt)
• Policy inattention ‘paradox of credibility’ permitted Minsky type crisis
to occur … view that aggregate risk had fallen … fuelled more
borrowing (see Minsky box in CORE Unit 17)
• Inattention to implications of trends in income distribution for financial
fragility – reliance on sub-prime lending to sustain aggregate demand

Learning in macroeconomics
• Lessons of economic history are important … claim (made during the 2
decades of the Great Moderation prior to the GFC) that the new policy
regime had brought boom & bust to an end was not sensible
• Assumption that advanced economies would not have banking or
sovereign debt crises was mistaken
• BUT there is evidence of learning by economists & policy-makers:
• policy responses to the crisis reflected lessons of the Great
Depression (see charts in Chapter 7 comparing post-GFC with postGreat Depression)
• BUT history shows recovery from debt-type crises is slow & painful &
and that ‘too early, too harsh’ austerity can delay recovery (more
recent research is pointing in this direction)

Unusual post-crisis behaviour in US & UK
Questions:

1. Is this ‘secular stagnation’?
2. What are the implications for monetary policy of a low natural
or stabilizing rate of interest? (and of r* at a global level)

Unusual post-crisis behaviour in US & UK
Questions:
1. Is this ‘secular stagnation’?
2. What are the implications for monetary policy of
a low natural or stabilizing rate of interest? (and
of r* at a global level) – uncomfortable times.

In our model, the question is:
what keeps the IS curve
depressed at the global level?
Which supply-side and
demand-side factors
a) are depressing investment
• S-side – falling innovation
potential (e.g. Robert
Gordon), slowing labour
force growth
• D-side – coordination
problem of low aggregate
demand
a) are raising savings
• S-side – aging populations,
increasing inequality, rising
risk aversion
We do not yet know the
answer – there’s much still to
learn in macroeconomics!
