Course Webpage: Access through CUSIS
Tutorial Hours: TBA (optional, but highly encouraged)
Required Textbook: Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, Wooldridge, Jeffrey
M., Cengage Learning, 6th edition, 2016. The book is available at the University Bookstore,
CUHK. I highly recommend every student to own the textbook.
(Other editions are acceptable but the reading list and homework assignments are based on the 6th edition. Check with
classmates to make sure that you are reading the right chapters and doing the right problem set questions if you use other
editions.)

Course Description and Objectives:
The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the statistical methods that
economists use to test economic theory and interpret economic data. We begin with an
extended discussion of simple and multiple regression analysis. More advanced topics will be
tackled later in the semester, such as dummy variables, heteroscedasticity, instrumental
variables, binary choice models, panel data and time series. Problem sets will provide
students practical experience in applying econometric techniques to real world data.
Upon successful completion of this course, students should demonstrate their mastery of a
broad knowledge of regression analysis relevant for analyzing economic data, theoretical
background for the standard econometric methods used in empirical analysis, and skills of
applying STATA in regression analyses of empirical data.

STATA:
The computer program STATA will be used extensively in the course. One good introduction
can be found at http://data.princeton.edu/stata/. I will do some STATA demonstration in class.
Your TAs will also help you during the tutorial hours. You will have a chance to learn basic
knowledge of STATA in the computer lab (916) in ELB. Selected exercises will be given for
you to obtain skills on the basic programming and interpretations.

Requirements:
1. 4 problem sets (20%). Each problem set will count 5% in your final grade. Problem sets
will go out about every other week, and you will have 1-2 weeks to do them. You are
required to bring your hard copy problem sets to the classroom and submit them before
class time of the due date. No late problem sets are accepted. If you choose to hand in
late, a 50% discount is applied for each day after the due date. The number of days is
rounded upward, e.g. 1 day and 1 hour is rounded up to 2 days.
2. Midterm exam (30%).
3. Final exam (50%). Final examination will be cumulative, but will emphasize the
materials after the midterm exam.
4. Class attendance/participation (5% bonus). You are required to come to class on time.
We will randomly have few attendance checks. A random number of quizzes will also be
given in class as participation checks.

Recording:
Audio and/or video recording of the class is prohibited.

Key Dates:
1. The midterm exam is scheduled at class time (10:30am-12:15pm) on October 19
(Thursday). Arrive 10 minutes early.
2. The date of the final exam will not be known till late November as it is centrally
scheduled by the University. Early departure before the end of the exam period is
NOT a valid reason for absence from the final exam. Ensure that you are available on
these exam dates, as exams will not be rescheduled for any student for any reason.
3. There is a make-up class scheduled on November 14 (Tuesday) 6:30pm-8:30pm.
4. Students are responsible for announcements made in class and via E-mail.
