Course Description

This course introduces students to econometric time series techniques that are widely used to analyse economic and …nancial data. The course prepares students for more advanced study in this area, as well
as in applying these techniques to empirical studies. Topics covered include stationary and nonstationary
univariate time series modeling, multi-equation time-series models and volatility modeling.
