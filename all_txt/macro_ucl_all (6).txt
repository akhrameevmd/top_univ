Model-building:
1. Choice of exchange rate regime – costs and benefits of a flexible
nominal exchange rate
2. How was policy-making organized in the Eurozone? How did the
Eurozone perform?
3. Stabilization policy for a member of the Eurozone

Policy questions
• Policy response to common shock – the CB’s central bank
• Policy response to asymmetric shocks – is a national response
necessary?
• How can imbalances arise in a common currency area (CCA)?

The choice of exchange rate regime
Advanced economies club ‘OECD’ (34 countries):
__ floating exchange rates; __ ‘irrevocably’ fixed via Eurozone
membership; __ pegged to the euro
→ Think of the decision of whether to join a CCA
Microeconomic issues:
Benefits
• Single currency 
• Resource savings
• Increased competition 
• Increased liquidity in financial markets 

The economic case for & against joining a CCA
Macroeconomic issues:
• Optimal Currency Area (OCA) theory (Mundell) → cost of losing
exchange rate instrument
• Benefit
→ Three issues to focus on using models we have already developed
How does choice of exchange rate regime affect
1. economy’s ability to respond to shocks?
• in a CCA, what could substitute for loss of i and e (i.e. the
ability to choose y1 (via r0 different from r* and q0 ) to respond
to a shock (3-equation model)?
2. the credibility of the medium-run inflation rate?
3. the nature of shocks?

The economic case for & against joining a CCA
Q1. Exchange rate regime & response to shocks
Common vs. country specific shocks:

• Common shocks
• Which model to use?
• Country-specific shocks
• What happens if country has no monetary policy?
• Which model to use?

UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 9

Q1 (cont.) What difference does the exchange rate regime make?

A country-specific shock – an external trade shock
Suppose home country is subject to an external demand shock
• e.g. a change in tastes so that at given Q, its exports fall (i.e. fall
in σ, its share of world exports) … e.g. sudden fear that Japanese
cars are unreliable or German cars have emissions problems
How to analyze this, and what does it tell us about choice of
exchange rate regime?
1. Set up the problem
2. Look at solution under flexible exchange rates
3. Compare with Eurozone member (i.e. fixed exchange rates (no
monetary policy))
UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 9

11

Q1 (cont.)

Modelling an external trade shock (familiar)
• Fall in σ, country-specific
• Both AD and BT shift left
• AD′ and BT′ intersect vertically above y0 – why?
• What is the new medium-run equilibrium? Flexible e; fixed e;
vertical ERU; downward-sloping ERU?

Q3. Exchange rate regime & nature of shocks
We have done this before …
Review slides from Lecture 4
We know:
• With sluggish adjustment of wages & prices, nominal e volatility
is RER volatility; RER volatility can have real economic costs
• Real exchange rate volatility
• Overshooting in adjustment to shocks
• Shocks emanating from the forex market

Monetary policy

Fiscal policy

2. In the Eurozone, how does stabilization (policy) work?
2 levels
• Supra-national level. Monetary policy is carried out by CCA CB (in
Eurozone by ECB) →
• use 3-equation open economy model (Fig. 12.5)
• in response to CCA-wide shocks, CB sets r to achieve πT

• National level. What about country-specific shocks?
A. adjustment without policy intervention via real exchange rate and
real interest rate channels
OR
B. use of fiscal policy. In theory (but not in EZ), MR becomes PR
since policy-maker’s desired output gap is implemented via fiscal
policy
UCL ECON2004 TERM 2 LECTURE 9

24

Stabilization of country-specific shocks
Step 1. What happens if there is no active policy intervention?
Example: inflation shock
Two channels:
Higher home inflation (relative to CCA inflation) →
A. The Real Exchange Rate channel (RER)

B. The Real Interest Rate channel (RIR)

The key is how

Step 2. Using national fiscal policy to stabilize – mimicking
the use MP under flexible exchange rates
Example: inflation shock
Why use FP?

Instead of MP, modify 3-equation model to use FP with the same
loss function:

Application to the Eurozone’s first decade
1. Success of the ECB
2. Divergence in member countries … remember different motives for joining
Before the global financial crisis (2008):
Common characteristic of the crisis countries: current account deficit
2 types:
Type 1. Private sector indebtedness
Type 2. Excessive government deficits before the crisis
After the global financial crisis
• Common characteristics of the crisis countries:
• Current account deficit
• High level of government debt
• Attacked by the ‘bond vigilantes’
• Doubts about solvency … can government honour its bonds?
