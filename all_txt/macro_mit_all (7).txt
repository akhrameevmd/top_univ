slides are NOT a substitute for chapters 6 to 9 of the book. They are meant
to give you a more coincise and analytical presentation of the the Medium Run Model
but many aspects of the model that are discussed in the book are not in these slides,
and we shall assume you have read the book.

too bad in the short run: 4 to 6 quarters.

The Medium Run

The Medium Run
Think about what happens when …rms respond to an increase in
demand by increasing production
Higher production will lead to higher employment
Higher employment will lead to lower unemployment
Lower unemployment will lead to higher wages
Higher wages will increase production costs, leading …rms to raise
prices
Higher prices will lead workers to ask for higher wages
Higher wages will lead to further increases in prices
and so on ...
So far we assumed P = 1
We now move away from this assumption
To understand how the sequqnce of events described above happens
we need to undertsand
I how the labor market works: employm
! unempl ! wages
I

how …rms set prices given production costs

Labor market ‡ows: measurement
The Current Population Survey (CPS), is a monthly sample survey of
approximately 60,000 households.
Each month, the CPS is administered to about 40.000 households that were
also in the survey during the previous month.
The other 20.000 consists of new households
The month-to-month overlap allows the Bureau of Labor Statistics to track
individuals who change labor force status from one month to the next

How are wages and prices set
wage setting

W = P e F (u, z )
Let’s assume for the time being P e = P , so that dividing by P we get the real
wage W /P

W
= F (u, z ),
P

Fu  0, Fz  0

price setting: start from the production fct assuming only one factor, N and
constant returns to scale, so that marginal cost is W

Y =N
P = (1 + m )W
W

P
