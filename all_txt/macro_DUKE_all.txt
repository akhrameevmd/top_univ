Office Hours: By appointment. Arrange an appointment either after class or by email.
Prerequisites
Economics 201D, and Mathematics 202 or Mathematics 212 or Mathematics 222.
Economics 205D is also required as a prerequisite or a co-requisite to be taken
concurrently with Econ 210D. If you do not fulfill the prerequisites you should not be
enrolled in this course.
Required Work and Grading
There are three required graded parts to the course. 1. Two midterm examinations 2. A
final examination. (Examinations are based on the content of the lectures and the reading
and may also assume knowledge based on homework.) 3. Homework exercises, including
problems from the textbook and empirical exercises. Homework is worth 20% of the
final grade. The midterms and final examination are together worth 80% of the final
grade according to the following scheme: the final is comprehensive; if the midterms are
better than the final, the midterms together count 40% and the final counts 40%; but if the
final is better than the midterms, only the final grade counts 80%. Each part will be
graded on an 125 point scale (explained below). The scores on the different parts will be
normalized (common mean and standard deviation) and averaged. The final grade will be
curved to approximate the typical departmental distribution (roughly 15-20% A’s; 4045% B’s; 30-40% C’s and 5-10% D’s and F’s). The parts are described in more detail
below.

Economics 210D Syllabus
Grades will be given on a 125-point scale:
125 = exceptional answer beyond the highest expectations (practically, better than the
answer key)
100 = excellent: correct and effort well beyond the minimum
75 = acceptable: generally good with only minor errors
50 = poor: seriously attempted the work but with major errors
25 = extremely poor: less than acceptable effort and/or fatal errors
0 = no gradeable work
How these grades translate into letter grades depends on the curve as described above.
Policy on regrades: A students who disagrees with homework or midterm grades may
submit his or her work for regrading by giving it to me with a written statement that refers
to the answer key explaining what is wrong with grading. The whole homework or
examination will then be regraded. All errors in grading – positive or negative will be
corrected. All requests for regrades must be submitted within one week of the section in
which your homework is first returned (whether or not you or there to pick it up).
Academic Ethics
I will hold you to strict standards of academic ethics. If you have any questions about
whether work you do for this class is in conformity with Duke’s standards of academic
ethics, see me before turning such work in.
I encourage students to discuss economics and the class material together, to help
each other in solving problems in coming to understand the material. Nevertheless, work
submitted for a grade must ultimately be the work of the individual student – not copied
from another student or from any other source. In particular, you may not copy any
homework directly from another student’s work on paper or electronically. Your work is
to be your own – not a group effort. Thus, while you may discuss the work in general or
particular problems that you are having, in the end each student must complete the
assignments individually. You may not copy any material used in this class in earlier
semesters (be warned, that sort of copying is especially easy to detect and in any case
data changes over time). In any work using outside sources quotations must be properly
indicated (e.g., by quotation marks) and sources of information and ideas that are beyond
the commonplace properly documented. My policy is to refer all cases of academic
dishonesty to the Duke judicial authorities. So, Don’t Cheat.

Reading
Required Reading: Kevin D. Hoover, Applied Intermediate Macroeconomics
(Cambridge University Press.)
In addition, I strongly urge students to keep up with current economic events by
reading some combination of: The Wall Street Journal, The Economist (London), The

New York Times. All of these are available in print and online, and student subscriptions
at good rates are available. I may, from time to time, distribute supplementary readings
as well. Another good source of topical economic analysis are the popular publications of
the Federal Reserve. Every one of the twelve Federal Reserve banks has a variety of free
publications aimed at wider audiences. Some of these are available in the library. Two
particularly useful ones to students are the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
Economic Letter (available online free; go to http://www.frbsf.org/economicresearch/publications/economic-letter/ and The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
Economic Commentary (available online free
https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/Newsroom%20and%20Events/Publications/Economic%
20Commentary). Both publications provide short, popular discussions of topical
economic issues weekly. They are well worth your trouble the trouble of subscribing.

Readings for each topic indicated by chapter number in the course textbook. The
schedule of lectures is tentative and may well change depending on how things go; the
schedule of examinations, however, is firmer. Midterm dates are not likely to be
changed; and if they are, there will be adequate advanced notice.

Economics 210D Syllabus

The examinations will primarily cover the material in the lectures and assigned readings,
but may also refer to things you might have been expected to learn from homework as
well. The examination will consist of a choice of short essays and/or problems. Some of
the problems will refer to current economics events (it is part of the course that you keep
well informed). The time and date of the final examination are known in advance; they
will not be rearranged. Students with an officially certified need for special
accommodation should contact me early in the quarter so that I can make advanced
arrangements.
Calculators are essential for the examinations. You may use simple calculators only.
Calculators with massive memory, graphic capability, or the ability to communicate with
other devices are not allowed. No cellphones may be used in class or examinations ever.
If in doubt check with me well ahead of the examination. I will not supply calculators or
other test-taking materials during the examinations. Come prepared.
Bluebooks are required. (Engineering bluebooks, which are large and have graph
paper pages, are best.).

Part 2. Homework
There will be weekly homework assignments. Assignments will be posted on the course
website. Sections are not optional but an integral part of part of this course. Homework
will be turned in only in class on the assigned day and returned only during section.
